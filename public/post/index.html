      We’re nearing the point of saturation when it comes to data science blogs. The amount of reccomended Medium, Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, or whatever website you can post to articles that come up on my suggested reading on my phone is unending. Why? Because aspiring data scientists have repeatedly been told that one of the best ways to break into data science is to:
 START. A. BLOG.
 You, an aspiring member of the workforce, not only should be refining all your technical skills as you apply for jobs, brush up your LinkedIn profile, refactor all that code from that one project you still have yet to set to public on Githhub, but in addition to all that (and your normal life) should devote time to writing data science blogs.

      It’s been two months since I’ve last blogged! In the time since SMPC, I’ve done a fair bit of traveling and officially closed the graduate student chapter in my life. Most importantly, I ended up going back for my Ph.D. graduation back in Baton Rouge. I know a lot of people don’t walk and see graduation as kind of just another prom or wedding industry (it is, don’t get me wrong), but given that I have spent the majority of my 20s pursuing higher education, I wanted to fully experience the ritual that was its ending.

      Next week is SMPC!!! I’m super excited for it (as always), but this year I’m justifiably a bit more excited because this will be my first experience going to a conference as a member of the Executive Board representing the student members of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition. I’ve technically spent the last six years as a graduate student1 and even though I’ve just recently shed my graduate student status and will emerge this coming weekend from my chrysalis as beautiful doctoral butterfly, the feelings of being a grad student larva are still very fresh.

      I read somewhere on the internet that if more than three people email you with the same question, it’s worth writing your answer up in a blog post. Over the the course of my Ph.D I’ve gotten a few questions from younger students ranging from MCCL@LSU lab members to complete internet strangers (mostly because of a very old blog post I did for MajoringInMusic.com ) about pursing music cognition at the master’s level as a means of a career path.

      After a year, my time is now up as a Residential Volunteer Worker at Toynbee Hall. Given everything that’s happened this year (dissertation, travel, destroying my shoulder), I haven’t really got to blog about my experiences at Toynbee, but seeing as it’s been a sizable part of my life the past year, I wanted to take some time to reflect on what I have been up to the past year. Keeping in line with my ideas on career diversity, many of my reflections here will be for my presumably more academic-ish readership.

      Things Are Different Now Hello, first-blog-post-since-I-defended-my-Ph.D! It’s wild to think that after five or so years (between starting the the MSc. and the final Ph.D. defense), I am finally done with graduate school. There are no more exams, no more term deadlines, and no more giant documents to write. The last few months felt like quite the pressure cooker between writing everything up, flying back to defend, then doing a bit of travel.

      Background Not everyone might be aware, but in addition to living that dissertation life this past year, I have also been volunteering at Toynbee Hall as part of their newly re-started Residential Volunteer Worker program. The program started WAY back in the late 1890s. The idea was that all the bougie people from Oxbridge would come and live on-site in East London in order to do charity work and help out a bit before they were to go on to do other things like be elected to Parliament and then pass laws and help those that were not as well off.

      Since I am planning on spending the whole day today writing, I figured: What better way to warm up to some writing than with some writing?1 And what better way to get the juices flowing than to write about the wonderful experience that was the Sempre graduate student conference at Cambridge this past Monday.
If you’re reading this in North America, you might not be familiar with Sempre, so for the uninitiated, Sempre or the Society for Education, Music and Psychology Research is a professional organization in the UK dedicated towards bringing together those in various fields of music, but specifically music education and music psychology.

      I obviously could not resist writing a blog post about yesterday’s Google Doodle twitter buzz. I’m not going to try to talk about some of the smaller issues that came up. And tons of people have already said interesting things, but instead I’m hoping to ride the buzz so I can talk about something very relevant to the discussion: encoding and digital representation.
Using Imani Mosley’s blog post as a jumping off point, she makes many great points about what Musicology twitter was interested in.

      One of the biggest issues that I lament about regarding Twitter is how there is so much great information just falling through my feed, never to be recovered again. A perfect example of this appeared yesterday when Will Mason tweeted asking for people to help provide examples of idiomatic instrumental constraints leading to funny pitch choices.
Within one day, there were loads examples of this along with some discussion contextualizing the responses.
