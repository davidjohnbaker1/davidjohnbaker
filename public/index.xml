      <title>Sempre Grad Conference, 2019</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I am planning on spending the whole day today writing, I figured: What better way to warm up to some writing than with some writing?&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
And what better way to get the juices flowing than to write about the wonderful experience that was the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sempre.org.uk/&#34;&gt;Sempre&lt;/a&gt; graduate student conference at Cambridge this past Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this in North America, you might not be familiar with Sempre, so for the uninitiated, Sempre or the Society for Education, Music and Psychology Research is a professional organization in the UK dedicated towards bringing together those in various fields of music, but specifically music education and music psychology.
I don’t think we really have something like this in the USA.
The music psychology people tend to hang out at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.musicperception.org/&#34;&gt;Society for Music Perception and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;, and I am kind of embarrassed that off the top of my head I don’t know where graduate students in music education might submit research they are working on to present to their peers?
According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sempre.org.uk/about/1-background&#34;&gt;Sempre’s website&lt;/a&gt;, they’re very keen on helping out researchers at the start of their career and having this graduate conference is just one of the ways they do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference this week was a short and sweet one-day affair held at the Faculty of Music at Cambridge.
Of course the weather was perfect that day, but luckily all the talks made it worth it to sit indoors all day.
Ian Cross welcomed everyone with a short the opening address and if my memory serves me correctly, he noted there were about 80 submissions to this conference.
He said most of those submissions did happen to come the day of the deadline, which is quite in line with any stereotypes one may have about graduate students.
But thinking about that, I feel like if all professional music organizations were to release the timestamp data of their abstract submissions, there wouldn’t be a single one that didn’t exhibit an exponential growth in submissions in the hours leading to the deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his short introduction, the keynote speaker Martin Rohrmeier, head of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dcml.epfl.ch/&#34;&gt;Digital and Computational Musicology Lab&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_Polytechnique_F%C3%A9d%C3%A9rale_de_Lausanne&#34;&gt;École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne&lt;/a&gt; was introduced.
Martin’s talk surveyed a lot of his previous work on using computational tools to model various aspects of tonality which showcased the work of his graduate students in attendance that day.
He also presented an overview of his lab’s work looking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/110/38/15443.full.pdf&#34;&gt;hierarchical, embedded structures within larger forms&lt;/a&gt;.
All of this empirical work then was tied together with what Martin put forward as a possible general theory of cognition and aesthetics that would be available to the listener, were they to choose, to engage deeply with a work of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing his audience as the next generation of music researchers, he made several pleas throughout his talk to encourage future work in music to work at the intersection between music theory, music psychology, and computer modeling.
This is an idea often gets poked at over here in Europe quite explicitly, but seems to live more as a tacit assumption in a lot of work in North America unless you’re at a talk by David Huron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day took an ABA form with five minute flash talks surrounding a longer 12 minute talk session and the poster session scheduled for lunch.
As I tweeted earlier, I was skeptical of the five minute talks at first, thinking “How could people cram all they need to say into five minutes?!”&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but seeing as this was only a one-day conference that was more about community building rather than getting in the nitty gritty about methods, the format worked well.
Because of it, in a one-day session we were able to hear about the research of 20 graduate students on a diversity of topics (not even including the 25 posters at lunch!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of the talks in the morning session addressed issues at the intersection of music and well-being with the exception of a paper by Daniel Harasim looking at unsupervised machine learning methods to examine jazz harmonies.
Listening to all these talks only reiterated assertions made earlier in the keynote of how many human resources are needed in order to push knowledge limits in the field of music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the afternoon session was reminiscent of last summer’s multi-hub ICMPC conference as the winner of Sempre’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sempre.org.uk/awards/hickman&#34;&gt;Hickman&lt;/a&gt; award, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/LAWarrenburg&#34;&gt;Lindsay Warrenbug&lt;/a&gt;, skyped into the conference to deliver her paper on Melancholy and Grief in Music.
It’s nice to see the music science community putting their money where their mouth is on making remote presentations a possibility for presenters (something also heavily advocated for by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/site/sysmusconference/&#34;&gt;SysMus Series&lt;/a&gt;).
Not to throw shade, but this is something that my home discipline of Music Theory needs to do a bit of catch-up on.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I look forward to the inevitable SMT Discuss or Twitter feud where we discuss if a person who can’t be to the national meeting in-person should instead be swapped out for someone who can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the talks in the afternoon were all extremely interesting.
It’s hard to go through and single out work I was loving since most of the work I liked was done by people who were good friends, but one paper that I feel like the theory and psychology community should be looking out for very soon was the work by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pmcharrison&#34;&gt;Peter Harrison&lt;/a&gt; and his advisor Marcus Pearce.
In 12 minutes, Peter was able to explain the current theories in the literature surrounding instantaneous consonance and dissonance (is it periodicity, is it spectral interference, is it cultural familiarity?), introduce an aggregated behavioral datasets from four prior studies where participants rated various sonorities, then introduce a new R package, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pmcharrison/incon&#34;&gt;“incon”&lt;/a&gt; that they used to computationally model 15 models of consonance to get to the bottom of the story.
If you’re interested in his findings, I know he also has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://psyarxiv.com/6jsug/&#34;&gt;pre-print&lt;/a&gt; of it out right now.&lt;br /&gt;
I only mention his paper in detail because I think what he is doing is very in line with the music theory world and will hopefully start an interesting conversation once it gets published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the day we’d have heard talks on musical chills, emotions and music, using music to help rehabilitate stroke survivors, music’s role maternal mental health in The Gambia, and posters on topics from more traditional music theory (thinking about hierarchical voice leading structure ala Schenker with Graph Transformations) to decentering the dominant discourse of the ‘Dead White Men’ cannon.
It was a great day.
Not only did the conference have a diversity of talks, but of the 20 talks, there appeared to be 50/50 split in the gender of the speakers.
I only note that so when the inevitable “But is it even possible to have a conference where we just have men talk?!” question arise, there’s documentaiton of this happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to this conference and thinking about things like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://slate.com/technology/2019/03/google-doodle-bach-ai-music-generator.html&#34;&gt;general rage from last week regarding the Google Doodle&lt;/a&gt; made it very clear that there are many, many ways to do music research.
It made me wish that there were more conferences that follow this design beyond the graduate level.
I am only lamenting about this because if all goes well in May, this past Sempre conference will have been my last as a graduate student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this brings up ideas about the “point” of the conference, but one important “point” is that I don’t think conferences should just be be about apex research at its final moment of metamorphosis before publication.
I feel like we as researchers need more of a chance to air out our ideas in a less, shall I say… performative setting.
I obviously acknowledge that the content and subject matter with a conference like this is very different to that of AMS or SMT, but honestly think that the culture of something like Sempre is much closer to what people want and need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true for early career researchers where point is to build relationships, explore new ideas, and not start to drink that academic Kool Aid right away since numerically speaking we will not all be academics, but will hopefully all engage in some kind of music research.
I’m also advocating for this because I’m currently in the peak of my PhD isolation phase now writing and going to this and being inspired by peers is what I think I’ll need to cross the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So big thanks to Sempre for hosting it, allowing for a day of intellectual curiosity, and continuing to grow a healthy network of next generation of researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital Representations</title>
      <link>/post/digital-representations/</link>

      <guid>/post/digital-representations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I obviously could not resist writing a blog post about yesterday’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach&#34;&gt;Google Doodle&lt;/a&gt; twitter buzz.
I’m not going to try to talk about some of the smaller issues that came up.
And tons of people have already said &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@tompkinsguitar/googles-bach-ai-a-machine-learning-scientist-with-a-phd-in-music-theory-reacts-68d055f2461d?fbclid=IwAR1CuMvjwoAC1o0EPfBU5pa2mglRKp5BLcHpydh82HxHNktosxA3Ns7QgAg&#34;&gt;interesting things&lt;/a&gt;, but instead I’m hoping to ride the buzz so I can talk about something very relevant to the discussion: encoding and digital representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/imanimosley&#34;&gt;Imani Mosley&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imanimosley.com/humanistmachines/2019/3/21/breaking-the-doodle&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; as a jumping off point, she makes many great points about what Musicology twitter was interested in.
One thing that I was most struck by were claims the reason for the snark was the tired Bach-as-machine trope to explain why scientists gravitate to Bach.
In this post, I want to provide an alternative possibility of why researchers gravitate to Bach.
Researchers like Bach because it’s already encoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Imani points out in her post, the dataset is made up from 308 compositions that the model was trained on.
You can read more about the model &lt;a href=&#34;https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but each Chorale has many more musical events/data points.
Navigating to where the Bach chorales live on my computer and running the &lt;code&gt;census -k *.krn&lt;/code&gt; humdrum command on the first 308 of the Bach Chorales (just to ballpark) that were edited by Craig Sapp results in 72,030 note heads that can be analyzed with tools that can interpret &lt;code&gt;kern&lt;/code&gt; data.
This is a subset of 120,528 humdrum tokens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/digrep/kern1.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bring this up not to start debates about how much data is needed to train a model, but rather to point out that each little bit of data here had to be entered by hand for it to be used in any model.
And there is no way that you could get a model to even come close to output that would be interesting without very clean data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a researcher looking to tackle problems in this domain, having something like a complete set of Bach’s chorales in a digital format is a fantastic resource.
But one of the problems in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_musicology&#34;&gt;computational musicology&lt;/a&gt; is not the depth of data used to try to make a machine part-write in style of Bach, but rather the breadth of representation researchers can chose from when they pick which data to model.
How is it possible to make generalizable claims if you only look at a very small subset of music?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, I work a lot with music and often use computers as a tool in that research.
Unlike the Bach problem here, I am interested in melodies, but the types of data and tools to analyze this data are similar.
One of the major problems I face in my work is that in order to make robust claims about music, you need to be able to show similar phenomena happen with new data.
But where does this new data come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re a data scientist, you might get this from scraping a website or a government database.
If you’re a music psychologist, you often get data from experiments.
If you’re a computational musicologist, new data is not nearly as accessible.
Most likely, you need to either find some or create a digitized version of that data yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take the former option, you first inclination might be to go to somewhere like &lt;a href=&#34;http://kern.ccarh.org/&#34;&gt;kern scores&lt;/a&gt; or see what something like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://simssa.ca/&#34;&gt;SIMSSA project&lt;/a&gt; curates and to see what is available.
If you pop on over there for a second, you see a sample of what you can select from.
For the most part, it’s like a worse version of the old dead white dude problem that is being faced in both curricula and the performance world right now.
That said, there is still tons of data there.
Based on what is current there, the kern scores page has 7,866,496 notes from 108,703 files.
In addition to a lot of dead men, we also get a lot of folk songs, primarily with Hurons’s digitizing of Schaffrath’s work with the Essen collection.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
You’ll notice that there are not a lot of complete sets of lieder, full-on symphonies, or much new music (copyright and public domain are obviously also an issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take the latter option, you have to do encode these melodies yourself and digitizing music is not fun at all.
Over the past year, I encoded 778 monophonic melodies using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://musescore.org/en&#34;&gt;MuseScore&lt;/a&gt; platform.
These 778 melodies resulted in 36,387 notes, a vast majority of which I did personally.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
It sucked.
I hated having this giant encoding project living over my head throughout the dissertation writing process.
And since I am fresh out of it and still in peak bitter stage, thinking about this whole thing feels very much like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Red_Hen&#34;&gt;a little red hen situation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, this kind of work could remain to be resigned to the individual.
Encoding a corpus could follow the lonely scholar in the ivory tower model where digitizing so much music is a sort of rite of passage.
But I don’t think that’s the best way forward for anyone involved.
I think encoding needs to be much more of a community effort and we can look to fields like psychology of how we as music-types might remedy this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in psychology, undergrad students taking psych courses in the USA are generally required to take part in experiments which generate the data for the papers that the field of psychology generally reads.
Using such restricted samples leads to problems in that this data is basically &lt;a href=&#34;https://slate.com/technology/2013/05/weird-psychology-social-science-researchers-rely-too-much-on-western-college-students.html&#34;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/a&gt;, but I think you could argue it’s better than not collecting any data.
In music, we don’t really have this problem as much because our research is not this-kind-of-data driven, nor should it in many topics.
But in cases like the one I’m describing here, we have our own litte weird problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To remedy this, I imagine a world where in teaching music theory– where often competence in a computer notation is a learning objective– we spend a bit of time talking about this problem of (digital) representation in music.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
If every classroom were encodes some pop melodies (also a transcription exercise!), encode a Shostakovitch Fugue (a project I have been putting off for years now), or even encode one part of a symphony, all of this data would slowly start to accumulate for anyone to model.
Doing this would lead to a deluge of new data for researchers to use, allow for Meyerian comparisons between styles, and teach students about serious pressing problems in research while having them learn about notational software.
This also will expose them to the field of computational musicology, something that I didn’t even know existed until half-way through my Masters in &lt;em&gt;psychology&lt;/em&gt;.
Additionally, once compositions cross into the public domain, we as a research community can work towards having more music, more accessible to more people in the form of open scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it could be that there is this tired trope of Bach-as-machine (which certainly plays into it), but I’d be interested to know how much of what we do is just by-products of the means we have to answer those questions.
Either way, as noted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Komaniecki_R/status/1108825660653473792&#34;&gt;Robert Komaniecki&lt;/a&gt;, hats off to the Google team for getting people to get so fired up about part-writing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/post/wikiwednesday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues that I lament about regarding Twitter is how there is so much great information just falling through my feed, never to be recovered again.
A perfect example of this appeared yesterday when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/willmasonmusic&#34;&gt;Will Mason&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/willmasonmusic/status/1105462217728761857&#34;&gt;tweeted asking for people to help provide examples of idiomatic instrumental constraints leading to funny pitch choices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/wiki_20190313_post/will_tweet.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within one day, there were loads examples of this along with some discussion contextualizing the responses.
Examples like this happen all the time on Twitter ranging from people needing specific musical examples to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DougShadle/status/1066802040217759744&#34;&gt;killer Twitter rants like this one&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DougShadle&#34;&gt;Doug Shadle&lt;/a&gt; that took me way too long to find, which only proves my point.
After liking the tweets, that’s usually where my engagement with the information ends, then I get sad that this information will never be available again for anyone who was not on Twitter yesterday.
I know it lives on Twitter and can dig it out, but I honestly feel I should be spending less time on my computer when I find myself telling more senior music scholars things like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Oh, actually, there was a really good Twitter thread about this the other day”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can be done?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, one thing that I think a lot of people forget about is that all this information can and should be put on Wikipedia.
After looking at Will’s thread, I put “Idiomatic Music” in the Wikipedia search bar, and was directed to this &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_idiom&#34;&gt;stub of a page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/wiki_20190313_post/pre_edit.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I would have hoped to find the information on Will’s tweet if I were looking for it on another day, but it’s not there.
So in true “knowledge should be for everyone” fashion, I added it to the page and thought this might be a good opportunity to procrastinate writing my dissertation by writing a blog about my favorite dissertation writing procrastination activity: editing Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;editing-wikipedia&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Editing Wikipedia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I have been meaning to blog about, and this obviously has given me a good reason to, is how easy and important I think it is for academics to edit Wikipedia.
It’s so important that I have even turned my love of editing Wikipedia into something I personally refer to as #wikiwednesday.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, #wikiwednesday is just a weekly reminder that I should add something to Wikipedia every Wednesday.
For the past few weeks, I have been doing it on topics related to my dissertation, but in this post I honestly wanted to show how easy it is to edit Wikipedia for anyone that hasn’t yet.
Hopefully after seeing a few screenshots, you too will be inclined to help out as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing that you need to do is make an account.
I made a quick one just for this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/wiki_20190313_post/make_account.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now with an account made, the next thing that you need to do is click the Edit Source button found in the top right corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/wiki_20190313_post/editsource.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here (at least my my Firefox?) there’s the option to use the Visual Editor mode.
If you’re not familiar with Markdown and HTML and what not, this is the way to go in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/wiki_20190313_post/viz_editor.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here, this opens up the hood and you can start editing.
I am personally in the process of doing the last 50 days of my dissertation, so I seriously do not have time to restructure this page, but I do have time to add in a bit of text (and do this quick blog post).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, all I wanted to do was create a new heading that would provide some examples of this, then write some very OK text with some concrete examples from Will’s thread.
The text is not poetic by any means, but it’s better for it to be there than not.
And if you think what I wrote sucks, you can always change it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adding all this in, I then tried to link in some of the composers and examples with the link tool.
It might take a second to get a handle of how this works, but it’s time well spent in my opinion.
After a few minutes of editing….&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_idiom&#34;&gt;Tah Dah!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;wiki-ing&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;wiki-ing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of me wanted to just keep going and adding to this page, but my hope is that people will read this post and do a bit of their own #wikiwednesday-ing and just try to do one small edit on this page or another.
I find that once you start, I think it’s pretty fun and actually kind of hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is it fun (my opinion), but I also think that if you are an expert in something (cougheveryonewithaphdcough), you have a responsibility to edit Wikipedia in your own subject area.
Not only is it important to give people up-to-date and accurate information, but Wikipedia is also a place where most people probably start most of their inquiries.
And this isn’t just undergrads, the amount of times I have seen people crack open Wikipedia on their phones at an SMT or AMS talk on a subject outside of their realm of expertise is pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I think this is so important is because this writing will be more read than any article I write in any journal (especially if it’s written behind a pay wall!) and probably have more of a cumulative impact than most of my research.
Also, knowing that Wikipedia is probably the best empirical evidence of what we as a community canonize, it becomes so important to make sure that Wikipedia is representative of the world we want to exist in.
I’m obviously not the first by any means to point this out.
There has recently been coverage of Wikipedia’s diversity issues by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/history-has-a-massive-gender-bias-well-settle-for-fixing-wikipedia/2019/02/15/b2537640-3163-11e9-86ab-5d02109aeb01_story.html?utm_term=.72aa4b49348f&#34;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; and anyone that is not living under a rock (aka not on Twitter) knows that the music community is actively working towards &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annakijas.com/rebalancing-the-music-canon/&#34;&gt;Rebalancing the Music Canon&lt;/a&gt; as blogged about by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/anna_kijas&#34;&gt;Anna Kijas&lt;/a&gt; and working towards more accessibility of music from historically under-represented composers by initiatives like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MTEW_com&#34;&gt;Music Theory Examples by Women&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ComposerProject&#34;&gt;The Institute for Composer Diversity&lt;/a&gt;.
All I am trying to get across with this post is how important I see it for anyone with skin in the game to take a bit of time out of their day each week and make a habit out of putting information out where most people read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is being done too, I guess I just am hoping for more of it.
I’ve seen that some people like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/K_Leonard_PhD&#34;&gt;Kendra Leonard&lt;/a&gt; starting to organize Wikipedia sessions (couldn’t find this exact tweet to link in?) to create and edit pages on Women composers.
In my opinion, if both &lt;a href=&#34;https://societymusictheory.org/&#34;&gt;SMT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amsmusicology.org/&#34;&gt;AMS&lt;/a&gt; put aside 2 hours each national conference to edit the music pages of Wikipedia, we as a society could take most of the year off of #publicmusicology (just kidding, but maybe not because that level of human resources editing Wikipedia would be unheard of).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on that note, I think it’d be nice if anyone interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23publicmusicology&amp;amp;src=typd&#34;&gt;#publicmusicology&lt;/a&gt; would join me in my weekly small edits of Wikipedia and share small portions of what they did with #wikiwednesday to remind others to also help out.
Or you could get back to devoting all your time to that article that most people probably will not read (#shotsfired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;My love for editing Wikipedia pages grew out of taking extensive notes on a server that my advsior, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/danielshanahan&#34;&gt;Dan Shanahan&lt;/a&gt; set one up for our department to facilitate collective knowledge for our department.
Of course those posts live in on a “private” wiki, but they will one day see the light of day when I either blog about them or try to get all that info to Wikipedia.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Cataloging Memories with Music</title>
      <link>/post/cataloging-memories-with-music/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 21 Dec 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/cataloging-memories-with-music/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The past few times that I have sat down to work on my dissertation I have run into a writer’s block.
Though it is not the kind of writer’s block where nothing comes out.
The past few times I have set aside time to write I have had &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; thoughts that I have not been able to just stick my nose to the ground and write.
My brain feel like it’s on fire.
It’s the end of the year and it has been an intense one and it’s important to acknowledge that.
Too often in grad school we work and work and work and work, and never reflect on how we even ended up in this situation in the first place.
There is too much doing and not enough reflecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to attend to that problem, as opposed to just tweet about how we need a change of culture (but really be frantically work on yet another manuscript) I set aside some time yesterday to write about something I have been wanting to share for a while: my auto-biographical musical playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;darling&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Darling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general background and inspiration from this post and idea comes from some music science literature investigating how music has the power to evoke strong emotional memories that are not related to the structure of the music itself.
There has been some cool work on it that you can read about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09658210701734593&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55ac0a53e4b05f2993b25780/t/55c9ffdde4b0e9393a61707c/1439301597483/Belfi_etal_2015_Memory.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; that digs into it properly, which also runs in tandem with research suggesting why &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24006129&#34;&gt;really like the music we listened to in our formative years.&lt;/a&gt;
But for all the intents and purposes of this post, all you really have to know is that there is good evidence to suggest that a strong link exists between music and memories of specific moments in our lives.
Ages ago, when I first started getting into music science I heard this referred to as the “Darling, they are playing our song!” effect and &lt;strong&gt;I wanted to see if I could use some of this research in my own life&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a result of reading about this area of research in music science, a few years ago I decided to start keeping a playlist diary on Spotify.
The idea of it was that I would add a song to the playlist whenever I had a strong experience associated with music.
The experiences did not have to be exact mappings such as this exact song must be playing during a certain moment for it to be added to my playlist; the idea was that any memory that might be bottled up in a song could get added as not to make the inclusion criteria that strict.
This of course is naturally much easier for a musicophile like myself who basically always has music playing or is around music.
All that needed to happen was for me to be a bit more mindful as I went about my life.
If a song comes on that seems like it is painting a nice soundscape to the backdrop of my life, it gets added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;results&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have been running this experiment on myself for the past four years.
It’s the end of 2018 now, so what got added to it this year?
Here is a link to the playlist itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/user/1220215602/playlist/3rfnbRTo1WVReR4exGvNjE&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am writing this post I have been listening to the playlist and, like the past few years, when listening to it, I get immediately transported back to the memories I actively chose to catalog.
The first couple of songs take me right back to celebrating the New Year with my friends in Baton Rouge.
For example, I remember the second tune, Lambada, coming on the radio as my friends drove to buy food to make breakfast after a long weekend in New Orleans.
The moment felt right, so I whipped out my phone to Shazam the tune, and then later added it to my list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3F7HdGevVojxdsARD4RHad&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not just exact moments that I catalog, but I also record re-occurring songs.
For example, later on the list is some Debussy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/00IZ3ndf3TNXt3hMum4WAV&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the music, but more importantly it’s used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(TV_series)&#34;&gt;Westworld&lt;/a&gt; and I used to have weekly Sunday screenings of the show at my apartment in Baton Rouge.
I wanted to remember sitting quietly in a room with my friends having a bit of a break before Monday would come up and grad school would restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;patterns&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day I’d like to look at the list and maybe see some patterns over a lifetime.
For example, I’d imagine that more songs/memories would cluster around highly anticipated emotional events.
I saw this play out last year with two salient songs from my PhD General Exams.
The first example is this great tune my friend Crystal put on in my living room after a day of drinking celebrating being done with three days of writing for the first part of our General Exams and learning the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwJ66XxGBFk&#34;&gt;line dance&lt;/a&gt; to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/42excP3MyVua6modv3v9Pz&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few weeks and the night before my oral defense, I remember sitting in a Sonic parking lot eating ice cream with my friends Sasha and Jacob, listening to Eye of the Tiger at full volume.
It was a moment where it felt like God had momentarily DJ’d for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2KH16WveTQWT6KOG9Rg6e2&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruising through this playlist I also realize how much traveling I did this year and all the great people I got to hang out with.
Just weeks after Eye of the Tiger, I got to hang out at a public musicology conference in South Carolina and ended up hanging out with both &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/darkmusictheory?lang=en&#34;&gt;darkmusictheory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/12tonevideos?lang=en&#34;&gt;12tone&lt;/a&gt; late at night in an AirBnB and remember really liking the piano intro to this tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4L1eqdFY10yO7tMzvRp0sx&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of my playlist comes from memories traveling.
In Florida I remember sitting with my friend Rory while talking about how we are spending our lives and this recording of &lt;em&gt;A Mi Manera&lt;/em&gt; came on the radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0Nx5c4i2z90wi8Uj6LbUbH&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first vacation/holiday I had ever taken just for the sake of a vacation (not academic work related) in years and I distinctly remember sitting on the patio, asking the server to start happy hour early, mis-ordering our 2 for 1 margaritas, then both being served 2 drinks at 2PM and boozing it up in full Jimmy Buffet regalia.
Of course I won’t go on a play by play&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of my whole list, but the meaningful thing is that as a whole this playlist only ‘makes sense’ to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone looking at the playlist might be able to figure out some of the tunes given that they knew where I was at what time such as this recording added at the start of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1b7kLkJkr6XRYgWqVmDm05&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But other songs that I have known for a while get emotionally recycled and obtain new meaning just for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6pGEheBKHMS6cvYqqKcU6O&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;zooming-out&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zooming Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the cool thing is, as I mentioned above, I have been doing this for the past four years.
Going all the way back to 2015 I can still vividly transport myself back to eating donuts in an NYC apartment listening to Laura Mvula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6VKhTOUK905auFiINtfLZZ&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;380&#34; align=&#34;center&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even as the 2015 playlist plays, I still anticipate each song within this playlist’s context with each memory being anticipated as well.
So what I guess I am basically suggesting is that on a personal level, if you have an assortment of external musical meaning your life, maybe it is time to consider starting an autobiographical musical memories playlist yourself in 2019?
I have found knowing that this playlist is there helps me stay more present when music is playing (which is a lot of the time) since you never know if a moment will meet your inner arbitrary threshold for adding it to the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also be interested to know if anyone after reading this does go ahead and do it.
I’d be very keen to have an intense music psychology conversation about similarities in partaking in this activity.
I’ve also linked here the past four years just for proof, but also want to show off how diverse this kind of playlist can get since it’s not bound by anything like genre, style, mood, or some sort of lyrical similarity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;replication&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Replication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/post/examining-musical-sophistication/&#34;&gt;Replication&lt;/a&gt;.
Is it popular and important for research in psychology?
Yes.
Will reading a replication paper get you all fired up about research?
Probably not.
That’s OK though, research really shouldn’t be all about new and flashy findings.
Every so often we should stop and think about what we are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today our lab has a new publication “Examining Musical Sophistication: A replication and theoretical commentary on the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index” that’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/qwVM6dhD6ipcWM4XAacv/full&#34;&gt;accessible online&lt;/a&gt; that replicates the &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089642&#34;&gt;Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index&lt;/a&gt;.
The “just-tell-me-if-I-can-keep-using-it” verdict of the paper is: “Yes, knock yourself out”.
Scroll to the bottom of the page, grab the APA citation and cite us as Baker, Ventura, Calamia, Shanahan, and Elliott (2018).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re keen on psychometrics and are interested in a few of the points we make in the paper, then read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give the very short version of the paper in plain English (not abstract-ese) the paper generally goes like this.
Over the past century the world of music science has struggled to quantify what it means to be musical.
We clearly need some measure of it if we want to make claims about how much engaging with music relates to other constructs, but every time you try to pin down what you think being musical is, you realize you forgot something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;measuring-musicality&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measuring Musicality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have tried to get around this problem a few different ways, but in this paper we decided to focus on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089642&#34;&gt;Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index&lt;/a&gt; since it’s a tool that has getting very popular, very quickly within the music science world and had previously been shown to be valid and reliable in a large UK sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the paper came from a lab meeting one day at LSU where we were discussing open science and our own research practices, and how we wanted to participate in this important movement.
Given the resources we had at the time, we decided it would be a good idea to investigate the replicability of the Gold-MSI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a couple of specific reasons for this as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most researchers are not going to be using samples like that in the original paper (N= 147,000+) and will probably just use it on their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20550733&#34;&gt;WEIRD&lt;/a&gt; subject pool, therefore we should investigate if there are any “weird” things that happen when you use it like this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some researchers break off a part of the Gold-MSI and use just one of the sub scales; is that a good idea?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An independent replication of the Gold-MSI would be a valuable contribution and it’d be good to write a paper that might be helpful for others to read and cite.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had also just read this great paper on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1153946&#34;&gt;Process Overlap Theory&lt;/a&gt; and saw a lot of parallels between what Kovacs and Conway had to say when arguing against the idea of &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; and the idea of measuring anything musical with a latent variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we went ahead, grabbed us some data, and spent a lot of time reading Alex Beaujean’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Latent-Variable-Modeling-Using-R/dp/1848726996&#34;&gt;Latent Variable Analysis with R&lt;/a&gt; book to dive deep into the world of latent variable modeling.
So what did we find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;practice&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the Gold-MSI pretty much behaved as you would expect it to.
Using a WEIRD sample, we had a bit of a skewed distribution that people should look out for, but the sub-scale scores pretty much lined up with the means and standard deviations that were originally reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/Figure1_GMSIREP.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overall Skew&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Similar Descriptive Statistics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, we did look at the item level data and found anything but normal distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the biggest deal in the world due to the estimators you can use with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://lavaan.ugent.be/&#34;&gt;lavaan package&lt;/a&gt; that were used in the original paper, but if you are going to break off a scale to use just a part of the Gold-MSI, it’s worth keeping in mind.
We noted the biggest problems with this using the Emotion sub-scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also show have &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; of tables in the paper that go over everything from descriptive statistics to model fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;theory&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our generally successful replication, is there anything else researchers should know?
We we zoomed out a bit (from painfully up close to the Gold-MSI) and expanded outwards in our discussion.
In the paper we highlighted that the Gold-MSI uses latent variables, which basically relies on the same math as calculating &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
The construct &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is calculated using a bunch of objective tests that correlate with one another, but you still use factor analytic techniques to derive the larger constructs, in this case the General Sophistication score and its sub scales (actually it is even fancier than that since they use &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02289209&#34;&gt;a bifactor solution&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After pointing this out we draw upon a few arguments made by Kovacs and Conway and argued that even though someone might score highly on some of the Gold-MSI scales, it doesn’t mean that they are using their “musical sophistication” to actually carry out musical tasks.
Just like you wouldn’t say you used your general intelligence to solve a mental rotation puzzle, you wouldn’t say you used your musical sophistication to do a melodic memory task.
We note that this is great for descriptive theories, but we just want to remind people that they shouldn’t confuse a statistical abstraction for any sort of process that is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get a lot more fanciful with the language in the article, but hopefully you’ll give it a read if you’ve gotten this far in the blog post.
The paper ends saying that people should of course keep using the Gold-MSI as we desperately need more consistency in measurements, but as a community we need to think about what our models are actually telling us.
This is especially true in that we are now coming up on the 100 year anniversary of Seashore’s Measures of Musical Talents and it’s a perfect time to stop and reflect on the tools we are using and the questions we are trying to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds up your alley, give the paper a read.
You can access it &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/qwVM6dhD6ipcWM4XAacv/full&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and if you’d like to cite us, just copy and paste below!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Project Management with git and R</title>
      <link>/post/project-management-with-git-and-r/</link>

      <description>&lt;div id=&#34;staying-organized&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Staying Organized&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The semester is finally over meaning it’s time to put some serious dents into my research projects. I’ve got a couple floating around at this point, but the one that I need to think about the most is my PhD dissertation. From what I’ve heard it’s quite an intensive ordeal and given that over the next year I need to write a multi-chapter document with a dissertation committee spread across thousands of miles, I think it might be important to try to &lt;strong&gt;stay organized&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of different people I follow on Twitter have suggested that I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview&#34;&gt;Scrivner&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of writing and what not, but for the past year or two I have really been trying to push myself to commit exclusively to using &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software&#34;&gt;Free and Open Source Software&lt;/a&gt; for everything I do. For some time now I have been thinking about trying to write my entire dissertation using all things &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt; and I think I’m ready to try it. I don’t want to get on a rant here about FOSS and how great R is, but let me just give a few reasons why I want to head down this path as opposed to using proprietary, paid software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning the ins and outs of all of this is going to make me a better programmer/researcher over the course of the next year (more skills = more employment options!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with this will help make my work more accessible and reproducible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I’m not only going to try to write my thesis using only free software (I’m sure there will be exceptions), but one thing I also want to do is to document as much of the process as I can so that anyone else (especially those without computer backgrounds!) can do the same if they would ever want to learn these sets of tools. I’ve always thought it’s a shame that a lot of this software is not common place in the Humanities and hope that through blogging about how to do it, it will help others who want to use it find it easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do you even start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;r-projects-and-github&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;R Projects and Git(hub)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting a new project, the first thing that I normally do is to create a place on my computer where the entirety of that project can live and then link that up to &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; so I can share what I do with the people I work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will just walk through how to just set up a version controlled project with R via Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-one-create-a-repository-on-github&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step One: Create a repository on Github&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find it’s easiest when starting a project to start on github first, then copy that onto your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is to log into your github account (assuming you have one, it’s easy to sign up!) and create a new repository (repo) using the little plus at the top right of your home page as you can see below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Navigate to New Repository Page&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Navigate to New Repository Page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here you want to give your repo a name, a small description, and tick the box that asks you initialize it with a README file. The screenshot below shows the page right before I click the green “Create Repository” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Setting up your repo&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Setting up your repo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing a name, it’s important to pick something easy to recognize and type. Once you click ‘Create Repository’, it will take you to your repo’s home page and should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr3.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Blank Page&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;The Blank Page&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here you are going to want to click the green ‘Clone or download’ and then copy that link to your clipboard. The next screen shot shows what that will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Clone the Git HTTPS&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Clone the Git HTTPS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the link copied, you then want to open up your terminal (if you’re a Windows user, make sure to get &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Gitbash&lt;/a&gt;!!) and then navigate to where you want your project to live. I keep all my projects in a directory called &lt;code&gt;projects&lt;/code&gt; on my desktop for easy access. From here, you then want to use git to clone your project. If you’re totally new to using this kind of software to do work, you’ll also have to install git. If you don’t have git, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-mac/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; page will show you how to get it via &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt; at the command line, which, SURPRISE! you also have to download separately!! You can get that &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side note: when you are first starting out with all things computer-program-tech-whatever, you are going to need to get a lot of software before you can even start to use all the fun stuff. I remember this being particularly discouraging and no fun when I started. If you can, it’s best to try to get someone to slowly walk you through this via some &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming&#34;&gt;pair programming&lt;/a&gt;. If not, don’t be afraid to ask questions when you start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So getting back to what we were doing, you need to navigate to where you want your project to live (the first line) and then clone your directory by typing &lt;code&gt;git clone yourproject.git&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr5.png&#34; alt=&#34;Cloning Your Repo&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Cloning Your Repo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you look in your projects folder (or just press &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; as in “&lt;code&gt;l&lt;/code&gt;i&lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;t” all the files that are in your directory), you’ll notice you have a new directory sent directly from github heaven!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-two-making-it-an-r-project&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Step Two: Making It an R Project&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I’m going to primarily using R to manage this project, I then need to turn this directory into an R project so that every time I open this project, it can be governed with R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do that, I need to get out of terminal, and then open up RStudio. From here you need to go to &lt;strong&gt;File &amp;gt; New Project &amp;gt; Create From Existing Directory &amp;gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr6.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then navigate and select to open the folder you just cloned from github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr7.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you then tick the box that says to open the box in a new project, you’ll then see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr8.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tah dah! We’ve now made our directory an R project and can save our changes on github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-three-pushing-it-the-cloud&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step Three: Pushing it the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now all that’s left to do is sync up the changes on our local machine with that on github. We can bring terminal back and assuming that we are in our project’s directory (we can check that by typing &lt;code&gt;pwd&lt;/code&gt; in Terminal), we then need to enter the work life cycle of updating a github account with the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git add .
git commit -m &amp;quot;Whatever you did&amp;quot;
git push &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or how I did it with my project here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/pmwr9.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we then go back to our project page on Github.com, we can see that our changes should have been updated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that each time you start your project you want to &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that you have the most updated version of the project (for when you are eventually collaborating with other people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In writing this I actually realized there is SO MUCH that underlies this seemingly basic process of starting a project, so if anyone has any questions on this whole process, please let me know and I can try to make this post (and future ones) clearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>To-Dos and Boundaries</title>
      <link>/post/to-dos-and-boundaries/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 09 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/to-dos-and-boundaries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I write this sentence I know exactly how much time until my next break (45 minutes and 39 seconds if you’re interested). When my &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/activity-timer/id808647808?mt=12&#34;&gt;Activity Timer&lt;/a&gt; dings I’ll stop what I am doing, even if I am mid-thought and do something else. Maybe I’ll make a cup of tea, or maybe attend to that unread Facebook message, but most likely get on Twitter. I really have no idea what I will do, but I do know that as soon as my clock is not counting down I am technically ‘off the clock’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This might seem absolutely insane, but when it comes to productivity and being a graduate student, if you don’t find something that works for you, you’ll find yourself feeling unbelievably stressed at all times. I’m weirdly proud of my own productivity system and after a brief exchange with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/thomas_mock&#34;&gt;Thomas Mock&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter yesterday I figured it might be worth sharing. By documenting exactly how I do what I do, it’d also remind me to practice what I preach as I enter the last four weeks of the semester here at LSU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this falls into two categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To-do lists and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boundary setting at the local and global level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll explain each in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;to-do-lists&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;To Do Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best advice on to-do lists I ever received was from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/lewisrichard&#34;&gt;Richard Lewis&lt;/a&gt; when I was an RA on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tm.web.ox.ac.uk/&#34;&gt;Transforming Musicology&lt;/a&gt; project. He was managing a huge amount of the project, as well as his own work at the time and I asked him how he did it. He showed me his to-do list. It was a simple text file (come to think of it, I think it was &lt;a href=&#34;https://orgmode.org/&#34;&gt;emacs org-mode&lt;/a&gt;) and gave me the sage advice of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“only write down something on a to-do list that you can do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As dumb as it sounds, think of all the times you have written down something like ‘Write Final Paper for American Music Class’ as an item on a to-do list. You can’t actually DO that in one sitting (and if you DO do things like that, you might have a perfectionism/procrastination problem and HIGHLY recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Too-Perfect-When-Being-Control/dp/0449908003&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt; to read), but you can DO all the component parts of said project. What you have do is find a way to organize all the ‘things’ you have to do and break them down into manageable steps. I structure my to-do list hierarchically into all of the projects or classes that I am currently working on. My to-do list is a text file that I edit with VIM that takes advantage of &lt;code&gt;vimoutliner&lt;/code&gt; where you can find &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I access it by opening up my terminal (I also work as much as I can in terminal on Mac because I am easily distracted and like to feel like I am hacking in The Matrix) via an alias command. I just type ‘workflow’ into my command line and it opens up the to-do list. To learn how to set this up, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/make-an-alias-in-bash-shell-in-os-x-terminal/&#34;&gt;this link here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file is organized hierarchically and &lt;code&gt;vimoutliner&lt;/code&gt; color codes the indents. At the top of the file I have major deadlines that I shouldn’t forget about. As you look down the list there are high level headings like industry, lsu, and personal. Under each larger level umbrella is the actual project which has its own folder/directory (often linked to a github repo because I love those green commit squares). Then under the project are the actual to-dos. Each line starts with an action verb in all caps followed by something I could do in one sitting. Important to-dos get a &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; which my text editor colors as red, which I associate with as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what my current one looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/todo.png&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I am ready to work, all I do is type ‘workflow’ into terminal, then I have a whole list of things I can pick based on priority and what I have the mental energy for. By having a few things to choose and having everything written down my work is out of sight, out of mind for when I am not “working”. I often tell people that if I don’t write it down, I won’t do it. It’s a double edged sword because on the positive side, you don’t feel the mental heat &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DavidJohnBaker/status/983456868214468609&#34;&gt;I was tweeting&lt;/a&gt; about yesterday as things pile up. They are just all on your to-do list and you’ll get to them when you sit down to work. The negative side is that if you use this system and forget to write it down immediately, you will forget to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all this stuff to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;, how do I actually then &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; it? In order to answer that question, I need to take a step back and talk about boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;boundary-setting&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Boundary Setting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best and worst thing about graduate school is the lack of structure. It’s fantastic in that I can work when I want, where I want, and as long as I meet my deadlines, I wont be hanged, drawn, and quartered by my advisers. It’s terrible in that with no set boundaries, it creates this constant ‘I should be working right now’ culture (a world I am very familiar with coming from an undergraduate degree in music where you just replace ‘working’ with ‘practicing’). To be fair, my advisers would never do that, they might get a bit irritated but they are the nicest, most supportive people ever. I have found that the best way to work around this structure problem is to set very firm boundaries both at a local and global level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;local-boundaries&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Local Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest things to do with work is to just start. Often I don’t start to work because I feel like the problems that I have to tackle are just too big. Add in a bit of self-doubt, fear of your work not being good enough, and looming thoughts of a terrible academic job market that your peers constantly remind you of and it’s almost like why even bother? The best way I get around that is to just start working by picking a certain amount of time you think you can commit your full attention to something. It might be five minutes, ten minutes, the holy &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34;&gt;twenty five minute pomodoro&lt;/a&gt;, or you might have the juice to sit down for 50 minutes (this session). With that in mind, or knowing what I kind of work I feel like doing (writing, coding, emails) I press ‘start’ on my timer, open up my &lt;code&gt;workflow&lt;/code&gt; and pick one of the things I already wrote down to do that could be done in one session. While the clock is ticking down &lt;strong&gt;ONLY WORK ON THAT ONE PROJECT&lt;/strong&gt;. No Facebook, no phone, no Twitter. Don’t even start a conversation with your lab mate that walks in. If they start talking to you, practice saying ‘No’ to them and tell them you are doing a pomodoro session and will be done in 9 minutes and 19 seconds (current clock). When the timer goes off, stop. Even if you are almost done! The reason for this is that so you can get a quick breath so when you press ‘Start’ the next time, you will know exactly how to start your work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that doing this just a few times will get me in a much healthier place in terms of work life boundaries. And the best thing about it is as soon as the clock stops, you’re done and can make a cup of tea or coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;global-boundaries&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Global Boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other important catch to this system is setting global boundaries. What I mean by this is that you need to start working at about the same time every day and end at a reasonable time. I try to get into the office everyday at about 9AM and leave at about 6PM. It’s a long-ish work day (I take an hour lunch), but the best part is that having this regularity makes me happy. It might seem like I am just doing a 9-5 thing, but since I’m a grad student (and ABD right now) I can just stop whenever I want! The thing is I often do not because I weirdly really like what I do. The whole point of setting boundaries it to avoid burnout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to keeping semi-regular work hours I also do not have email or slack on my phone. My first music theory professor on my first day of class of undergraduate told us ‘there is no such thing as a music theory emergency’. He is correct. Most problems are not emergencies and the rest you get at night is much better than being on call 24/7. If you are staying on top of your work and working healthily to a goal, this system is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to prevent you from running into a place where you are submitting something at the last possible second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If after reading that you think “Dave, sounds like you just have a cushy grad position, you probably don’t work that hard. On the other hand I work 60-70 hours a week as a grad student!” I would have two things to say to you. The first is that I don’t believe you are as productive as you could be. I’d personally pay for the Go-Pro for you to wear all week and would be interested to know much time people accidentally waste each day looking at social media and doing other unproductive things. The other is that you might consider your ability to say ‘No’ to people. One of the hardest things I have hard to learn is to say ‘No’ and not let productivty creep happen (become more productive, get more time, fill free time with work). Saying ‘No’ is very hard but I actually got a lot of help learning about it when I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DrHenryCloud&#34;&gt;Henry Cloud’s&lt;/a&gt; book on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Boundaries-Updated-Expanded-When-Control/dp/0310351804/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1523372885&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=boundaries+book&#34;&gt;Boundaries&lt;/a&gt; about six years ago. I could do a whole blog post on that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is something to be said about just falling deep into your work, especially at the start of grad school, I always try to do a bit of self reflection and ask myself if what I am doing is sustainable. The first two years of my PhD were not and it lead to me being very depressed and irritable at times. I really credit some of these ideas I just detailed with moving away from a lot of those very toxic mindsets that permeate many academic’s social media feeds (WORK WORK WORK!). I’d really like to have my cake and eat it too with a healthy work/life balance and this is just one idea that moves me closer to that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also for those keeping score at home this post took 1 50 minute session, one 20 minute session, then I went to bed, and did three more 20 minute sessions to get it done and posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In addition to academic work, I&amp;rsquo;m also often involved as working as a consultant for various music industry projects.
One of the great things about working in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23musicscience&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;#musicscience&lt;/a&gt; is that there is a bit more opportunity to do consultancy work where theory can meet practice.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to hire me for anything from trying to find insight from your dirty data, to making data products, to scientific consultancy, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of projects that I have been involved with in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;soundscape&#34;&gt;Soundscape&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I am currently involved on a project with &lt;a href=&#34;https://soundscapeagency.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Soundscape Agency&lt;/a&gt; acting as their scientific consultant to help develop music in collaboration with various artists from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.erasedtapes.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Erased Tapes&lt;/a&gt; record label.
More information to come soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;soundout&#34;&gt;Soundout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soundout.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Soundout&lt;/a&gt;, I worked on a project with their lead data scientist &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabitha-trahan/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tabi Trahan&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas03dm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Daniel Müllensifen&lt;/a&gt; to develop a tool that mapped Music and Brand personality onto the same emotional space.
The details of the project can be found in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306374399_Matching_Music_to_Brand_Personality_A_Semantic_Differential_Tool_for_Measuring_Emotional_Space&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;.
The tool served as the basis for what later became their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soundout.com/brandmatch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BrandMatch&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;audio-branding-academy&#34;&gt;Audio Branding Academy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I presented with Dr. Daniel Müllensifen at the Audio Branding Academy annual conference in Berlin, Germany.
We gave a half-day workshop on tools that help bridge gaps between academics, creatives, and industry minded people.
A summary of our workshop can be found in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284721150_Music_Brands_Advertising_Testing_What_Works&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;annual yearbook from that year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hire Me (as a Data Scientist!), Part IV</title>
      <link>/post/hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-iv/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-iv/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since this is my last post in the beer review series, I’ll keep this short and sweet in terms of analysis. Having done all of this, I do have a few reflections I would like to share after doing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali/&#34;&gt;One-Size-Fits-All-Data-Science Interview&lt;/a&gt; that I have included at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final question to answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty broad question and should be able to be answered without many pitfalls, so let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: package &amp;#39;data.table&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beer &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;data/beer_reviews.csv&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
Read 56.7% of 1586614 rows
Read 1586614 rows and 13 (of 13) columns from 0.168 GB file in 00:00:03&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a bird’s eye view, it seems like the most sensible thing to do would be to look at our data from the highest level, then just zoom in until we have the level of granularity we feel answers the question well. Let’s first average all the beer styles to get a rough estimate of how a beer style fairs on the variables we are interested in, and additionally see how much variability is associated with that measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sem &amp;lt;-function(x) {sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))}

question4.means &amp;lt;- beer[, .(mean_aroma = mean(review_aroma), mean_appearance = mean(review_appearance), mean_overall = mean(review_overall),
                            sem_aroma = sem(review_aroma), sem_appearance = sem(review_appearance), sem_overall = sem(review_overall),
                            sd_aroma = sd(review_aroma), sd_appeareance = sd(review_appearance),sd_overall = sd(review_overall)), 
                        by = beer_style]
question4.means&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how each beer style fluctuates on our variables of interest (with our overall score thrown in for good measure!), let’s plot our results. Note that I have included standard error of the mean error bars as a sanity check to make sure that each beer’s ratings is not going to bleed into the others’ dimensions. By doing this, we can have a bit more confidence that we are looking at actually has some meaning. This plot shows the standard error on each of the two variables we are interested in, and for the most part it looks as if they are relatively well contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(question4.means, aes(x = mean_aroma, y = mean_appearance, color = beer_style)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_appearance-sem_appearance, ymax=mean_appearance+sem_appearance), width=.1) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=mean_aroma-sem_aroma, xmax=mean_aroma+sem_aroma)) + theme(legend.position=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance and Aroma&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Mean Aroma&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-29-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-iv_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph has a lot of beers, but what we are interested in is that top right quadrant where both the average appearance and aroma are maxed out. Let’s zoom in on it and throw in a sizing variable of the overall rating and inspect our graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(question4.means[mean_appearance &amp;gt; 4 &amp;amp; mean_aroma &amp;gt; 4], 
       aes(x = mean_aroma, y = mean_appearance, color = beer_style, size = mean_overall)) + 
  geom_point() + xlim(4,4.2) + ylim(4,4.25) +  theme(legend.position=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
 # geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_appearance-sem_appearance, ymax=mean_appearance+sem_appearance), width=.1) +
#  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=mean_aroma-sem_aroma, xmax=mean_aroma+sem_aroma)) + theme(legend.position=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance and Aroma&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Mean Aroma&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance&amp;quot;) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=beer_style, hjust = .5, vjust = -.75)) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-29-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-iv_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this subsection, it appears we have a few choices for beers that score highly on both Appearance and Aroma. The American Double / Imperial Stout looks like a good option as it scores higher on how it looks, but our Russian Imperial Stout has a higher Aroma score. We could start crunching more numbers here to find “the best” option, or at this point we could take off our data science hats and put our psychology ones back on (assuming that’s what we were wearing…) and run some double-blind experiments on ourselves to make sure that our data is actually lining up with something in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;reflections&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started out as a fun weekend project actually turned into a really great learning experience. I’ve definitely put a few solid hours into this and have gotten a lot out of it. I learned that my friends actually know a TON about beer and data science, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-lfs.github.com/&#34;&gt;git-lfs&lt;/a&gt; is something I wish I would have known about earlier, and that I’m actually looking forward to doing more blogging in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably have to go MIA for the next two weeks since my General Exams are coming up in early February, but I’m sure I will be back at it come late March. Until then, all I can hope for is that someone who is looking to hire a junior data scientist over the summer will come across these posts and think I might be a good temporary addition to their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
