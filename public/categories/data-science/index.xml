      <description>


&lt;p&gt;The past few months have been pretty exhausting.
On top of all things lockdown and the global pandemic, a little over a month ago I was told that my job was “at risk” of redundancy.
After going through the full collective consultation period, today is my last official day working as an employee of Flatiron School.
While this has been a bit of a shock, I’ve been thinking about my time at Flatiron these past few weeks and as my first prelude comes to its final &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence#:~:text=In%20a%20perfect%20authentic%20cadence,found%20at%20structurally%20defining%20moments.&#34;&gt;PAC&lt;/a&gt; and brace for the subsequent fugue&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I always find that writing about what is on my mind really helps me see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over everything I did mull over, it’s quite long so I’ve broken it up into three parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What Did I Just Do?: A prosaic setting of my resume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vocationtional Vicissitudes: My thoughts on why vocationalism versus the liberal arts helps me understand higher education&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Dream AD (Applicant’s Description): Things I Might Want to do Next with My Job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, thanks for caring about me and reading my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-did-i-just-do&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Did I Just Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past nine months I have been a Lead Instructor of Data Science at the London campus of the Flatiron School.
During my time there, I’ve led four different cohorts of students through an intensive fifteen week program where students with not much experience in coding or statistics or machine learning immerse themselves in order to learn as much as they possibly can from their instructors, the written curricula, as well as their peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bootcamp approach to learning is extremely different from that of traditional, liberal arts, higher-ed and while it can get a bad reputation for not being as exhaustive as spending four years doing something (duh), there are many things that bootcamps really excel at such as having so many learners concentrated into one space, all at about the same level of understanding, with near constant access to instructors to help guide a herd of overly eager learners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Flatiron School, I was mainly responsible for delivering material for the first two modules they took which were “Python for Data Science” and “Probability and Statistics” and was supported by a team of four wonderful people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of us are now also on the job market now and if you are reading this and want to pick up the scraps of a fantastic team, go add these people on LinkedIn. All you have to do is click the links below. They’re all fantastic educators and even better data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/wachirandaiga/&#34;&gt;Wachira Ndagia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsanzbecerril/&#34;&gt;Dan Sanz Becerril&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-f-s/&#34;&gt;Javi Fernandez Suarez&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioanapr/&#34;&gt;Ioana P&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also lectured a bit on other topics that I personally like a lot such as clustering, principal components analysis, and was always the one to give my obligatory Introduction to R and the Tidyverse workshop. We taught mostly Python, so I wouldn’t have been able to sleep at night without introducing them to R.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of today, we’ve graduated a sizeable batch of students and have placed many of them in jobs.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
We’re not at 100% yet like our &lt;a href=&#34;https://hi.flatironschool.com/rs/072-UWY-209/images/Flatiron%20School%20Jobs%20Report.pdf?_ga=2.75036818.1013998130.1593420746-1423311562.1570117877&#34;&gt;Software Engineering program was able to do&lt;/a&gt;, but I get messages from students when they eventually get jobs and it’s always the best part of my day.
Our students have gone on to work from companies ranging from start-ups, to educational programs like Flatiron School, to more high visibility brands like Nielsen and the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to all things teaching, I also got my first taste of being part of senior management, so I got to be on the hiring side of things for once.
I now understand what people mean when they say &lt;a href=&#34;https://jobs.telegraph.co.uk/article/does-your-cv-pass-the-30-second-test-/#:~:text=Research%20shows%20that%20most%20employers,CV%20was%20just%206.25%20seconds.&#34;&gt;people will only look at your resume less than a minute&lt;/a&gt;.
Being on the other side of the interviewing power-dynamic was surprisingly one of the most valuable experiences I will remember going forward.
I’ve also felt how the volatility of a business’ performance directly affects one’s work since our parent company was WeWork.
There were definitely ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of my time, I also got to help out with a bit of the curriculum development (I got to write some of the R materials for our graduate’s continuing education) that you can check out on the newly minted &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/teaching/&#34;&gt;Teaching&lt;/a&gt; section of my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a lot of work a lot of the time (especially at the start of the role and then again when we had to jump online) and it was 180 degrees in the direction of what I was doing before (writing my dissertation alone in my flat).
And although it wasn’t what I thought I would be doing straight after my PhD, I learned a ton from the work and found many aspects of the job very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-good&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far, the best part of the job was working with the bootcamp students.
This group of students was by far the most engaged collective of learners I have ever worked with.
To contextualise this, prior to teaching data science at Flatiron, the students from the two areas subjects in higher education I had experience with were both music theory and aural skills (a subset of music notorious for having undergraduates historically question the content area’s utility) as well as statistics for doctoral level psychologists (where a majority of the class was clinical psychologists who, for good reason, question both the quantification, reficication, and reductionism of quantitative methods).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to undergraduate music majors and clinical psychologists&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, none of the students at Flatiron were in my classes because they were “required to for graduation” and instead most of them had quit their jobs hoping to change the entire trajectory of their career.
You fork out a lot of cash to do programs like this and that’s not something they took lightly as students and thus it was not something we took lightly as instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this large time and financial investment, the students would absolutely rinse myself and the other instructors for questions every day to the point that by 6:00PM I was totally exhausted from so much face-to-face work.
This constant engaging with instructors and asking as many questions as possible is actually one of the big appeals of this kind of flavor of bootcamp; there are not many other educational settings where students have so much direct access to instructors and peers who are all on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we did our best to set boundaries with students it was hard not to engage with people who were so eager to learn.
The real trick that I eventually learned was to try to get the students to essentially bootstrap each other’s learning and move away from the sage-on-the-stage approach and move over towards as much group and active learning as possible.
I learned a lot about giving up control in the classroom and what you get when you start to acknowledge the fact that when you have adult learners, they bring with them far more life experience than those fresh out of school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of all this rapid learning, the last major thing that I loved about this job was getting to see so many students grow so quickly during their time as a bootcamp student.
Of course it’s true that you’re never going to learn everything in a bootcamp, but these environments are designed to get someone from near zero to competence so they can get in their own self-directed learning feedback loops where they can start critically thinking rather than adopting a pumping them full of knowledge approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now teaching in a bootcamp setting was not like anything I had taught in before.
The goal wasn’t to teach people the history of sciences or competing philosophies of science throughout the 20th century (though I did weave a lot of that in my lectures, not gonna lie); it was straight up about getting people the tools they need to get a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, I’ve now spent a lot of time thinking about the idea of vocationalism versus liberal arts education which I elaborate on in &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/post/begin-the-fugue-part-ii/&#34;&gt;Part II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the metaphor I used when I wrote about joining Flatiron&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to go into the numbers I keep here since that probably counts as sensative information to post publicly, but the students are doing well. We’ll have to wait for our next third part audit for the official numbers.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously there were some in each group that were really into each class, I don’t mean to portray this as apathy&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;vocationtional-vicissitudes&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Vocationtional Vicissitudes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After existing in this bootcamp space for the past few months, I feel like I am walking away with a very fresh take on what it means to teach in a vocational, rather than a liberal arts setting.
When the goal of the teaching is unabashedly “be useful in a neoliberal vocation” context, there’s a lot less theory (of course something I personally wasn’t the biggest fan of for hopefully obvious reasons) and much more honesty about what this specific type of student wanted out of their education: new opportunities for employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be very clear that I do not think that this approach should be the default goal of education (even though that is the new constant pressure), but now having experienced living in this bizarro world where success is defined solely by employment I now have a lot more opinions about the “value/values” demarcation in education.
In many ways, I very much agree with many goals of Flatiron in that there is a huge hole in the way things are set up now for vocational job training that doesn’t fit the traditional guild/apprentice model (electrician, plumber) and there should be more opportunities for people to accomplish this if they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true if it will lead to a marked difference in quality of life when it comes to their income.
This &lt;a href=&#34;https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020&#34;&gt;absurdly large differences in income&lt;/a&gt; has been benefiting people (white dudes) in tech for a long time, and opening it up to others via education is imporant.
It makes me very happy to have worked for a company that has made this a priority and has allocated &lt;a href=&#34;https://flatironschool.com/access/&#34;&gt;scholarship money for those that are underrepresented in tech&lt;/a&gt; and to have been able to pass on those opportunities to people I know personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course the idealist in me would go so far as to try to steer the next part of this conversation away from idea of social mobility (why don’t we just pay people all more than living wages and avoid classist ideas that value white collar above blue collar work) but the realist in me knows that this structure is entrenched in Western society right now so if there is a way to open the door to making more money and better quality of life for people through work, then people who can open that door need to open it as wide as humanly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;emulating-ideas-from-vocational-education&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Emulating Ideas from Vocational Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on the vocational versus liberal arts really has me thinking about that and what the future of what higher education could be.
Many of my academic colleagues know the pressure of being asked to demonstrate “transferable skills” in their curricula.
I literally was praised today for including a line in a course I plan on teaching this Winter for explicitly saying I will talk about career paths within music psychology.
Students rightly want to be able to make a living for themselves when they graduate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if we just follow the job market and placements as our only metric for success, I feel as though we really betray the entire goal of education.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs&#34;&gt;If you do think that, you need to get yourself a copy of David Graeber’s Bullshit Jobs immedietly&lt;/a&gt;.
Now I don’t want to fall prey to Rule Number 2 of grad school (“Be on the lookout for false dichotomies”) thinking we can’t have both, but as more pressure is put on higher education to use employment as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=kpi&amp;amp;oq=kpi&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l6j46.664j0j4&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&#34;&gt;KPI&lt;/a&gt; (a new term I learned this year) there is a lot higher ed can and should take from the vocational/bootcamp model.
If so much can be accomplished in so little time that can lead to better chances at employment, I am sure there is time during a four year undergraduate degree to equip them with what they need for employment (if they want to do this) that is not just a few resume review sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this might not be as big of a deal for some of my STEM colleagues or students, but I do think about what this would look like if there was some sort of vocational option for music students (my home field).
The irony is also not lost on me that when I talk about music students, I understand the historical links to a music conservatory, which again is all about going on to “work” as a professional musician (having lived that life myself).
But the reality that every one of my conservatory friends found post-graduation is that it is really, really hard to have a “normal life” as a performing musician.
You can gig a lot and do a fair bit of teaching, but you often find that many of your colleagues are bank rolled by their wealthy spouses or parents.
And on top of that, the hours don’t align with the “working day” (which I know not everyone wants anyway).
Or you can go on tour and basically give up your “normal life”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do this, you can be in the position to make a living, but it’s not exactly normal.
I know things are a bit different for Music Ed, but I’m more thinking about the many jobs that people with really fantastic music educations could do, but either don’t know exist or have zero job preparation to get themselves that role.
For example, the graduate student in musicology who has their finger on the pulse of the fantastic ideas going around academic circles, but would never have anything in their curricula about putting theory into practice at something like an arts organisation, let alone the connection from a professor to put them in touch with the person to get them employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could easily imagine what a summer intensive might look like for music students (especially grad students) looking to pick up the skills they would need to go alt.
I am sure there are tons of major orchestras or larger arts organizations that would benefit tremendously from music students who are like what I just described, but lack the mental model as to what power tools they need to be effective.
Just learning basic data literacy, enough programming to wrangle data and make convincing visualizations for the board, and tools for thinking to not make rookie inferential mistakes could all be learned in a setting like this.
Of course how I am thinking about it takes much more of a quant focus than what would traditionally be offered in a music school setting, but that’s kind of the point in that you’d be able to do both.
I can’t emphasize enough how much computer and research/data literacy (not even mastery) can add value to your organization when you couple it with the pre-existing expertise you have of your domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure a small group of students who just wanted to learn these in-demand vocational skills over the summer or an alt-semester, they’d be ripe and ready by the end of it to go on and help arts organizations or work somewhere else.
Maybe even set it up to lead to internships or something?
The new skill set would give them comfort in knowing all their eggs are not in the one basket that is music performance or the “academic job market” while not losing the culture of total immersion in music.
Just a little bizarro world like the one I have been living in for the past year for them to enter for a few months to give them something different.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I don’t know who is going to pay for that or if students would be interested, but it’s got my mind ticking after seeing what can be done in three months when you just stare into vocationalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole experience teaching in this context thing really felt like if you’ve had the chance to learn a second language (non-natively) like being a white kid learning Spanish in secondary school and even though you’re learning Spanish, you’re also learning more about English because you had no idea what you took for granted about your own language.
I will definitely be re-doing many parts of my teaching statement after the past nine months here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won’t be able to implement these zany ideas anytime soon, but I did want to put them out there now since I think this push for vocational skills within the liberal arts will only become stronger as funding continues to drop for higher education and students withdraw from enrolling until they can go back on campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll just end this section again here with repeating that I do not think that this emphasis on jobs should be the new standard for higher ed, but rather stealing ideas from the bootcamp model, annexing it as something separate for students who are interested, and then actually pulling this idea that liberal arts degrees need to be about employability out of the curricula so we can focus on deeper issues than just getting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now knowing I won’t be doing this next, what might I be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This takes me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/post/begin-the-fugue-part-iii/&#34;&gt;Part III of this series&lt;/a&gt; of me having a lot of time to think the past month, but no ability whatsoever to concentrate on my professional research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can already hear the response of “There is no room for this in the curricula! We barely can let go of Set Theory!” Maybe one day it can be a fun Twitter conversation.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;whats-next&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having coached many people to apply and get their first jobs in the world of data science, I have now seen A LOT of job postings and understand that a JD (job description) is more of a wish list of an ideal candidate rather than a required listing of skills.
On top of all of that, the characteristics you want out of your future colleagues (like all of the patience and kindness required to sit with a student as you explain how git works, a skill that our instructors seemed to have infinite amounts of, again add ,&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/wachirandaiga/&#34;&gt;Wachira Ndagia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielsanzbecerril/&#34;&gt;Dan Sanz Becerril&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-f-s/&#34;&gt;Javi Fernandez Suarez&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ioanapr/&#34;&gt;Ioana P&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn if you want this, you don’t even have to send a message) do not show up on resumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in that spirit, I want to end this post with posting my own description of what I’d like in my own work, maybe I can think of it as an AD (applicant’s dream!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I won’t hit everything that I’ll list here for my next line of work, but I have a way better idea of what I want out of my next employment having worked in my past role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;applicants-dream-ad&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Applicants Dream (AD)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, and probably most important, aspect I want of my next job is one where I am challenged in a way that leads to daily personal growth.
I found my work at Flatiron School to be challenging, but doing the same fifteen week loop over and over again so quickly made it feel more like I was getting better at some insane Shaun T HIIT work-out in terms of my teaching endurance rather than doing some sort of brain bulk (I hope my next employer likes colorful metaphors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing I really want is to be around people who are obsessed with what they do.
As soon as I was told that my job was “at risk” of being redundant, my first thought was thinking about applying for some sort of academic jobs.
Rationally, this is probably not the greatest idea considering the incoming COVID Higher Ed crisis, but I still felt this pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I spent a lot of time reflecting and thinking about this very irrational thought and after sitting with it for a couple of days I think that the main reason I feel this pull is because I know that academia selects for people who like and value the same weird stuff that I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point in life I feel OK telling people that I have extremely nerdy and niche interests compared to many people.
In conversations with many of my friends, I know that I like to dive much deeper into my interests and am the kind of person who reads textbooks for fun. (#iamverysmart&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)
I want to be around other people who are like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this has its serious downsides, I find it really, really difficult to have hobbies that don’t turn into obsessions and projects, but at least I am aware of that and OK with that now.
That is kind of what academia is and it’s nice to know that I am going to have traits like that in common with my future colleagues from Day One if I were to work in that setting, but I have learnt (in more of a feeling, rather than intellectual way) that academia is not the only place that this type of personality exists.
Again, this is very much like the learning Spanish analogy from before having worked somewhere where I didn’t think I would have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think it’s becoming a lot more common for many academics to work in industry after coming to this realisation.
At this juncture in life (and considering the future of the academic “job market”), it seems a bit wiser to still keep an eye open to whatever opportunities come up that are close to what I find meaningful, rather than getting too parochial too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So right now, what I really want to do next is keep investing in my technical skills, ideally in the area of where my domain expertise is which is music.
At Flatiron School, every so often when students would ask me a question where I didn’t know the answer right away, I had to remind them that the knowledge that I have about the world of data science is really only a by-product of wanting to answer questions that I have found personally meaningful in my own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I didn’t learn all this coding and stats stuff so I could just teach it (never in 100 years would I have thought I’d be doing that in my first year of my PhD); I learned it so I could ask really obscure questions about the the hierarchical structure of western tonal music in a subset of a WEIRD population known as Western conservatory musicians who are learning solfege.
That’s what I currently really like.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there market value in knowing that? Can I make the “business case” for that?
At this point, I’m sure I could spin it so there was something, but I’m OK with it standing on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I know that no one will pay me to do that (unless I can maybe secure some postdoc funding in that?) but I’m planning on using a lot of my time in the future to devote to my WEIRD interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then lastly, going forward to my next line of work it would be really nice to have a manager who was as kind as my old manager.
I remember being totally dumbfounded at the idea of “onboarding” coming from an academic background (hello baptism by fire with hidden curricula abound!).
The amount of support and questions and effort my manager went through to get to know me as I was starting was something I will take with me if I am ever in that position.
Big thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-g-miller/&#34;&gt;Ben Miller&lt;/a&gt; for everything on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then lastly, it would be nice, but obviously not necessary to have all the perks of working in industry like having a salary that allows you to be more generous with your money, no obligation to work off the clock, free coffee and beer (that will probably never happen again), and remote work options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;conclusions&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now a lot of this sounds like maybe the next step here is to maybe do a postdoc or try to secure a job doing music industry, but I would not be so bold with the amount of uncertainty that everyone is facing right now to say I know exactly what is next.
Even though I might know what I want, I’m fully aware that I need temper my expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I can’t land something right away, I have a lot of personal research projects I want to attend to in the near future and the fact that I want to spend my free time working on these probably is a big hint of what I should look at next.
I also have three fat textbooks I want to read this summer and have plans to brush the dirt off a lot of my programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I’d just like to end by saying that I had a great experience in something that I didn’t anticipate and just wanted to say that out loud for anyone else that reads this and might be in a similar position.
It felt like such a commitment signing my contract here, like I’d given up on what I wanted to do.
But here I am again, thinking about weird research in a much more stable position, using my free time to write papers and submit to conferences I find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I guess the real end of this should be if anyone knows of any gigs or jobs, either in teaching or research, please get in touch.
I’m cleared to work both in the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is ironic for people who are not on the internet as much as I am.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love teaching too, don’t get me wrong, but I’m hoping my pendulum swings a bit more near towards the research side next.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Blog on (Data Science) Blogs</title>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;We’re nearing the point of saturation when it comes to data science blogs.
The amount of reccomended Medium, Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, or whatever website you can post to articles that come up on my suggested reading on my phone is unending.
Why?
Because aspiring data scientists have repeatedly been told that one of the best ways to break into data science is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;START. A. BLOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You, an aspiring member of the workforce, not only should be refining all your technical skills as you apply for jobs, brush up your LinkedIn profile, refactor all that code from that one project you still have yet to set to public on Githhub, but in addition to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; that (and your normal life) should devote time to writing data science blogs.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot to ask of someone applying for jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as many of our students at &lt;a href=&#34;https://flatironschool.com/&#34;&gt;Flatiron School&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out, there is not only a sea, but an ocean of data science blog posts out there.
There are so many out there (of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/statsepi/status/1215932060172455936?s=20&#34;&gt;varying quality&lt;/a&gt;) and there seems to be such a push for aspiring data scientists to blog that one of our students joked (maybe not?) that their final project should be a bot that writes data science blog posts just to keep up appearances.
In many ways, I couldn’t argue with them, it seems that this advice of starting a blog and blogging is pushed on people wanting to break into data science and what results is a collection of very OK posts when you click around on &lt;a href=&#34;medium.com&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;.
This influx of blogs from people-yet-to-get-hired also means that there are a lot of people who are probably under-qualfied to write about the tutorial they set out to detail, especially if it’s about stats.
Hello &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning-Kruger&lt;/a&gt;.
In some ways, because there are so many posts out there, writing a bad blog post at this point would probably do you more harm than good.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I thought about this AI Blog Bot that one of our students came up with and the sea of bad blogs out there, deep down in my teacher bones I felt that starting a blog is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a good idea.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Like all thoughts, I couldn’t put my finger on it right away, but this post here is sets out to address the real reasons why in 2020 I &lt;em&gt;STILL&lt;/em&gt; think people should be starting a blog if they are interested in breaking into the world of data science (or really whatever you’re into).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-point-of-a-data-science-blog&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The “Point” of a Data Science Blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of data science, especially at Flatiron School, when we first introduce the idea of blogging to students they think that the “point” of writing data science blogs is to disseminate some sort of technical information.
For a newcomer to the field, this feels like a gargantuan task that almost validates someone’s impostor syndrome as they start to even think about topics in which they can address.
How can a student, someone who is just getting to grips with stats, programming, and machine learning have anything of substance to contribute to that sea of Medium posts?
In many ways, I think anyone new to the social media (Twitter, blogs) has a valid point in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re at a point now where knowledge is becoming so democratized that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DavidJohnBaker/status/1216639369093603329?s=20&#34;&gt;so many good resources exist&lt;/a&gt; that even as someone with a PhD with lots of teaching experience, I feel like I can’t compete with the sea of &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/&#34;&gt;free books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rdocumentation.org/&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg&#34;&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; out there in terms of making &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; content.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref4&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to think that the “point” of writing a data science blog post on a technical topic is to compete with someone like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw&#34;&gt;3blue1Brown&lt;/a&gt; explaining eigenvalues would be to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_eZmEiyTo0&#34;&gt;make one of the classic blunders&lt;/a&gt; and assume the “point” of writing a blog is that they are contributing the a giant ocean of knowledge that is “data science”, hoping to have their dribble “counts” as a meaningful drop to that big ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, on a deeper level, it’s more about writing blog posts that are about yourself and how you relate to the community of people that you eventually would like to be a member of.
This is important because “data science” is not some big monolith, but rather a community of people.
It shouldn’t be reified like a “thing” or some established part of the academy (let’s not forget how old data science is).
For me, it’s better thought of as a big network of people, all with various understandings of what data science &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;can be&lt;/em&gt;.
It’s about the people and you as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might not feel like that at first, especially with all the gate keeping that seems to perpetually exist, but people who make up data science are literally just other people.
This might seem painfully obvious, but if you think about this from a social media perspective, all things social media (blogs, Twitter, LinkedIn) provide direct access for you to join said community.
In my opinion, blogging without some sort of humanistic intent to make a connection with another person is just an exercise in bureaucracy.
It’s something a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilian_conspiracy_theory&#34;&gt;lizard person&lt;/a&gt; would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;blogging-and-social-media&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blogging and Social Media&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me expand a bit.
Social media and the online presence thing really never “clicked” for me until I started just interacting with other people and started getting reactions from “famous” people.
I still remember when I watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interrupters&#34;&gt;The Inturrupters&lt;/a&gt; when I was like 22 and I tweeted about how much I liked the documentary and one of the people central to the documentary– &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GSlutkin&#34;&gt;Gary Slutkin&lt;/a&gt; – not only liked the tweet, but commented back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It blew my mind that for a fleeting moment I had some sort of interaction with someone who I had no connection to.
And this really hasn’t gone away.
A few years later I remembering feeling like a nerd when &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hadleywickham&#34;&gt;Hadley Wickhamn&lt;/a&gt; liked one of my stupid tweets.
I even screenshotted it for my collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/blogblog/hadley_like.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course not every interaction is with someone that is “twitter famous”, the most useful connections I have had on Twitter were throughout my Ph.D. finding so many people that share a common interest (what lead to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23musicscience&amp;amp;src=typed_query&#34;&gt;#musicscience&lt;/a&gt; hash tag!!).
These connections have lead to things that I value (relationships with other people with shared intersts) and have also led to things of value (getting offers for data science gigs based on some of my data science posts) because I was able to start some sort of relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point I am trying to make here is not that it feels nice to get people to like your memes,&lt;a href=&#34;#fn5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref5&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but that social media allows everyone the chance to start a relationship with someone before you actually have a relationship with them.
By blogging and having a bit of a social media presence, you are able to kind of “front load” what that relationship could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by this?
What does does this actually look like in practice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-actual-point&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Actual Point&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion the point of blogs or front-loading the relationship can take one of two different forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first, which I tend to dub the “Twitter approach”, is to start building up your relationship before you actually meet someone face to face.
Coming from an academic background, this is mostly how I’ve used social media.
The name of the game is to just be you and rub shoulders with people who you know you will inevitably meet so that when you do meet someone face to face, you have some sort of idea of who they are &lt;em&gt;as a person&lt;/em&gt; so you can start your real relationship sooner and use the finite time you have together (normally at a conference) to then form a meaningful connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you adopt this mentality, then the act of “networking” (a term dreaded by most introverted academics who tell us how introverted they are) can become what it should be which is just making more friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course it’s not so easy as to just start tweeting, build a huge following, and then profit.
But I figure if you’re reading this blog, you’re already half way interested in this process.
You have to start slowly, just ‘Like’ weird stuff that the chronic posters post, and then get to know what people are like, and learn what people value.
A lot of the times it will be memes.
Some of time there will be a dumpster fire.
But there is a lot to be learned just watching it all pass by.
Eventually you’ll find your niche and the whole “twitter for networking thing” will start to make more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second way, which sort of seems more suited for blogging (but of course they interact!), happens the other way around where you meet someone in person (or maybe on Twitter) and you’ve already built up a bit of a small online presence via your twitter feed or a blog.
This might happen at a hackathon, or a conference, or even a non-work party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might happen something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You find yourself in a conversation with someone and realize that you have similar interests.
Maybe the person you’re talking to is part of a data science team somewhere and you’ve both attended the same meet up.
Maybe they have a position open and are looking to hire a new data scientist.
You bring up that you fancy yourself a bit of a data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who you’ve just met remains skeptical.
And they should.
Everyone wants to be a data scientist.
And to make matters worse everyone who wants to be a data scientist seems to have some sort of lame blog (written by a data scientist who has a blog).
The thing is, if you’re actually out there in the real world having a chat and enjoying yourself with someone you’ve done most of the hard work in the world of networking.
You’ve convinced someone that you are someone who the other person could imagine spending a lot of time with.
What do you do then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well you might mention you are looking for a job or to switch jobs and have been writing blog posts not to add to the big bureaucratic pool of data science blog posts, but because you have a certain amount of expertise that you want to share and like linking your weird interest in your area of expertise (in my case, music theory) to the world of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you depart, things are now out of your hands.
That’s totally fine, but if the person liked you, you know they are going to social media creep you.
If they find you on the web and like what they see, they can fill in the professional scaffolding of the person that they met or know.
Of course this is no guarantee that you would always get a job, but having something out there like a blog, an active twitter feed, or your Github profile is some sort of tangible evidence that you were who you said you were.
In the case of the blog, if you have written quality content for where you are in your career demonstrating you know what you know, have some idea of what you don’t know, and can articulate that clearly, you can really get yourself recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the end result here is to to help other people get to know who you are with the help of the internet.
If your goal is to land some sort of professional relationship with someone, this social media presence allows the person that will end up working with you a brief glimpse into what that relationship is going to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-blog-warning&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Blog Warning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I don’t think you don’t HAVE to blog to become a data scientist.
I could write tons more about the many ways this practice/culture could go wrong.
In my opinion there is a little too much of an emphasis on the blog thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if someone is not a great writer because English is their second language (assuming an English speaking workplace)?
What if someone doesn’t have the luxury of doing their whole life AND blogging? (It takes a lot of time…)
What if people just don’t like to write?
What if people hate social media?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all valid questions that should sit in the back of someone’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you are interested in blogging and you think that you would enjoy sharing, why not give it a shot?
Your first blogs might be lame, some of mine were/are.
Eve this one is kind of lame.
It’s a blog about blogs to just get me back in the swing of writing.
It won’t be the contribution that everyone remembers me by (hopefully) but might help out a few people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be really surprised about what good can come from it.
I’ve been told that two of the positions that I’ve worked for recently, that people have read my blog before and that it positively influenced a hiring choice.
We have numerous stories about blogs helping people get hired from my work at Flatiron School.
I’ve also been offered some freelance gigs.
Those would not have happened if I just had pushed some code to my Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will end by saying that you do decide to start a blog, it does take a long time.
At first you will think you will blog a ton.
That will eventually die down and that’s OK.
Creativity burnout is real and life happens.
Luckily a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/12tonevideos/status/1078766465338232835?s=20&#34;&gt;content creators are very open about this&lt;/a&gt; and help normalize this.
You should just blog when you want to or can or have something to say.
At this point I think of mine as more like a small outlet for myself to express myself and a vehicle to help others given the experiences that I have had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll end with some advice that I have been giving to some students that are on their blog game now, just so this isn’t a total ramble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write blogs that only you can can write. (My default answer when people ask if they should write about an introduction to supervised versus unsupervised machine learning.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write the kind of blog post you would want to read. (My default answer when people ask me how long they should be.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Literally write down the people you would want to read your blog at the top of your page when you’re drafting the post and write the post to them, erase their names when you’re done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cite your sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweet/Post on LinkedIn about it when you’re done writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t take them too seriously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate you know what you know and have a vague idea of what you don’t know&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to make other people feel smarter or more empowered to do something after they have read your blog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone likes pictures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include code people can easily copy and paste to try on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t start too much drama, a little is kind of fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, if you you struggle to write, that’s ok.
Writing is very hard.
If you find it difficult, try to stick to some sort of template.
If there’s any interest in sharing the materials we use at Flatiron School to help people get started, I’d be more than happy to for a future post.
This one is now too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, maybe start a blog in 2020, but take some time to really think about why you are doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I assume if you clicked on the title you’re here for that reason…&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It probably should go without saying, but if you write factually incorrect information on your blog, you are going to have a lot of explaining to do…&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also being tainted by a lot of suviorship bias&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn4&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret is you don’t have ot compete with it&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn5&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though always very nice&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>


&lt;div id=&#34;background&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; blog posts on “How to Become a Data Scientist” more often than I care to admit.
Much of this comes from a fear that after doing all this work on the PhD and then hitting the Music Theory job market, I won’t fit the mold of the kind of theorist most schools want to hire.
Not coming from &lt;a href=&#34;https://pushpullfork.com/music-theory-job-market/&#34;&gt;one of five schools that seem to have a monopoly on the tenure track jobs&lt;/a&gt; can be a bit discouraging, but I also won’t deny that having a non-academic job with a regular 9-5 schedule and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-scientist-salary-SRCH_KO0,14.htm&#34;&gt;decent salary&lt;/a&gt; is pretty tempting after spending the vast majority of my twenties in school.
And even if I don’t go on over to industry after the PhD, I’ll probably always be looking for a bit more work in summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of all of that, I believe that skills that are acquired in a PhD (especially if you do computational musicology and music cognition!) are very transferable to most jobs, and it’s just a matter of being a bit more pro-active in promoting myself that might help me one day land a stable, non-academic job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, one tweet I saw last week by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kierisi&#34;&gt;Jesse Meagan&lt;/a&gt; linked to this really interesting Linked-In
post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/tanyacash21&#34;&gt;Tanya Cashorali&lt;/a&gt; that purported to have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali/&#34;&gt;one size fits all data-science interview process&lt;/a&gt; which has candidates take home a big dataset with a bunch of beer reviews and answer four very broad questions.
Considering myself an aficionado of How-To-Become-a-Data Scientist articles, this of course caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the article, I figured why not give it a go?
It’s the start of the semester, I’m basically ABD, need more of a portfolio beyond &lt;a href=&#34;www.github.com/davidjohnbaker1&#34;&gt;my github&lt;/a&gt;, and I have nothing to do with my Saturday morning.
Why not see what I can produce in 4 or 5 hours?
At the very least I’ll hopefully just have something to point to if a future employer wants to see how I think through data-science problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if anyone is reading this that does have comments on my code or thought process… please let me know what you think on &lt;a href=&#34;www.twitter.com/DavidJohnBaker&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;!
I’d love some feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exploring the Dataset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I did was to grab this dataset which you can get &lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/demo-datasets/beer_reviews.tar.gz?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BDqDjqRycTlq5seB4xN3ocA%3D%3D&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and then I set up my R script with a few of my favorite packages (again, big love to Ben at &lt;a href=&#34;https://gormanalysis.com/&#34;&gt;GormAnalysis&lt;/a&gt; for helping me learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html&#34;&gt;data.table&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

#=====================================================================================#&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dataset has about 1.5 million observations across 14 different observations, so don’t try to open it in LibreOffice.
The reviews come from a variety of different users that have rated the beers based on five different attributes (Appearance, Palate, Aroma, Taste, Overall) and then each beer has a few other variables listed such as its ABV, the brewery it comes from, the beer’s name (duh), and what kind of beer it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a bird’s eye view we have 56,857 unique beers in 104 different categories from 5,743 different breweries and 33,388 unique beer aficionados who have gone out of their way to tell this website what they think about the beers they drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving in further, it’s worth doing a preliminary check of the quality of the data (aka we should know if this is BAD (Best Available Data) or has undergone a fair deal of cleaning).
As someone who comes from more of a psychology background, I’ve noticed what certain people consider “clean” when it comes to data varies a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I check for is if there is any kind of data missing and if there is, is it due to chance?
Or is it due to some sort of systematic variation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;table(complete.cases(beer))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
##   FALSE    TRUE 
##   67785 1518829&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;67785/1518829&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.04462978&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So about 4% of our rows don’t have every entry, so probably not too much cause for concern unless we start getting into specific questions about specific beers.
Looking into this a bit further it seems like it’s just beers missing the ABV of the beer.
Anyone who has made some beer ratings has made ratings on all five variables.
And although it’s only 4% of our entire ratings that don’t have their ABV, comparing that to every beer we have, we see we are actually missing ~25% of the ABV ratings of all of our beers.
That could be a problem later, but it’s good to know about it sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More problems might come up here or there, but let’s move on the first question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;which-brewery-produces-the-strongest-beers-by-abv&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering the first question on the list is pretty straight forward.
Essentially all you need to do is grab all of the observations that have an ABV associated with their rating, and then
get the average ABV of all the beers that that brewery produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Use object before that has only ratings with ABVs 
beer.complete[, .(AvgABV = mean(beer_abv)), by = brewery_name]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having this table could be good enough for government work, but looking at the output there are clearly problems, and one thing to consider in this table (and pretty much this whole dataset) is “Is this data point a good representation of what I am trying to measure?”.
Note for example the huge variability as measured by the standard deviation in our top answer as well as the fact that some of the SDs have NAs and there is a value of 0.
Given that, I think it’d be good to put on some sort of threshold that would up the quality of our answers.
One way to do this would be to see exactly how many beers each brewery makes and use that as a proxy for how big the brewery is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code below does just that and reveals the variability in terms of size of breweries within this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing it this way puts Schorschbräu as the highest ABV brewery, which makes sense because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/6513/51466/?ba=wordemupg&#34;&gt;they claim to make the world’s strongest beer&lt;/a&gt;.
Making a quick plot of the data for our winner and the second place finisher, we see how strong Schorschbräu really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;schor.abv &amp;lt;- beer.complete[brewery_name == &amp;quot;Schorschbräu&amp;quot;, 
                           .(beer_name = unique(beer_name)), by = beer_abv]

ggplot(schor.abv, aes(x = beer_name, y = beer_abv)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)  + 
  labs( title = &amp;quot;Schorschbräu Beer ABV&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Beer Name&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;ABV&amp;quot;) +
   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0)) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;brassOrg.abv &amp;lt;- beer.complete[brewery_name == &amp;quot;Brasserie Grain d&amp;#39; Orge (Brasserie Jeanne d&amp;#39;Arc SA)&amp;quot;, 
                              .(beer_name = unique(beer_name)), by = beer_abv]

ggplot(brassOrg.abv, aes(x = beer_name, y = beer_abv)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = &amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;)  +

        x = &amp;quot;Beer Name&amp;quot;, 
        y = &amp;quot;ABV&amp;quot;) +
   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = -90, hjust = 0)) + ylim(0, 60) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-14-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-i_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that saying Schorschbräu is technically correct here, but after sharing my findings with my one beer drinking friend
he pointed out that one thing that this analysis did not take into account was that beers
that are traditionally brewed to have a higher ABV (like IPAs and Belgiums) might skew my results.
So if you are a big IPA brewery, you are going to have higher average ABV because of the beers you decide to brew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the true spirit of that &lt;a href=&#34;http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram&#34;&gt;data science Venn diagram&lt;/a&gt; noting that data scientists need to be flexible in
incorporating others’ domain knowledge, I did another analysis to just show how much an answer can change depending on how you change your operationalization of the question!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do another one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up for this one is making a plot of the data to see how much beers actually vary from type to type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Get mean and SD of each beer type 
abv.by.type &amp;lt;- beer.complete[ , .(MeanAbvType = mean(beer_abv), 
                                  SdAbvType = sd(beer_abv)), 
                              by = beer_style]

# For Graphing, order, set style as factor 
ordered.abv.by.type &amp;lt;- abv.by.type[order(-MeanAbvType)]
ordered.abv.by.type$beer_style &amp;lt;- factor(ordered.abv.by.type$beer_style, levels = ordered.abv.by.type$beer_style)

# Code for plot, blogdown crunches the images 
# Average ABV by beer type
# ggplot(ordered.abv.by.type, aes(x = beer_style, y = MeanAbvType)) + 
#  geom_bar(stat=&amp;quot;identity&amp;quot;) +   coord_flip() +
#  labs(title = &amp;quot;Average ABV by Type of Beer&amp;quot;,
#       x = &amp;quot;Beer Style&amp;quot;,
#       y = &amp;quot;Mean ABV, bars represent SD&amp;quot;) +
#  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=MeanAbvType-SdAbvType, ymax=MeanAbvType+SdAbvType)) +
#  theme_bw()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/abvtemp.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can see here that if you wanted to have a higher ABV on average for your brewery, you’d benefit from having more IPAs, Barley Wines, and Belgian Stouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now with average ABV for each beer, let’s then match that to our big list, find how each beer fairs against its own category, sort them, and then combine them with our information from before on how big the brewery is.
For the purposes of this example, let’s only look at breweries that have over 100 beers in the database and look the top 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Combine ABV per type data with complete data
beer.complete.avg.abv &amp;lt;- abv.by.type[beer.complete, on = &amp;quot;beer_style&amp;quot;]
# Make new z score variable based on other beers in group
beer.complete.avg.abv[, zABV := (beer_abv-MeanAbvType)/SdAbvType]  
# Get averages per brewery on z variable
zAvgBeers &amp;lt;- beer.complete.avg.abv[, .(AvgAbvZ = mean(zABV)), by = brewery_name][order(-AvgAbvZ)]
# Combine back with our data on proxy of size of brewery
BreweryAndAvgAbv &amp;lt;- zAvgBeers[NoOfBeers, on = &amp;quot;brewery_name&amp;quot;]
# And the winner is...
BreweryAndAvgAbv[N &amp;gt; 100][order(-AvgAbvZ)][1:25]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at this list, we get a totally different answer.
It appears that on average &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2097/&#34;&gt;Kuhnhenn Brewing Company&lt;/a&gt; brews their beers 1.26 standard deviations above the mean of all other beers in that category!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both answers could be technically correct, but more importantly demonstrate how important it is to come up with how you frame your question first, and then try to answer it so you don’t end up going on a fishing expedition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on to question #2!&lt;/p&gt;
