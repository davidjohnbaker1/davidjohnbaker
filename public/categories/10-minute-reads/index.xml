      <title>Hire Me (as a Data Scientist!), Part IV</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since this is my last post in the beer review series, I’ll keep this short and sweet in terms of analysis. Having done all of this, I do have a few reflections I would like to share after doing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali/&#34;&gt;One-Size-Fits-All-Data-Science Interview&lt;/a&gt; that I have included at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our final question to answer is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty broad question and should be able to be answered without many pitfalls, so let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: package &amp;#39;data.table&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beer &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;data/beer_reviews.csv&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
Read 56.7% of 1586614 rows
Read 1586614 rows and 13 (of 13) columns from 0.168 GB file in 00:00:03&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a bird’s eye view, it seems like the most sensible thing to do would be to look at our data from the highest level, then just zoom in until we have the level of granularity we feel answers the question well. Let’s first average all the beer styles to get a rough estimate of how a beer style fairs on the variables we are interested in, and additionally see how much variability is associated with that measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sem &amp;lt;-function(x) {sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))}

question4.means &amp;lt;- beer[, .(mean_aroma = mean(review_aroma), mean_appearance = mean(review_appearance), mean_overall = mean(review_overall),
                            sem_aroma = sem(review_aroma), sem_appearance = sem(review_appearance), sem_overall = sem(review_overall),
                            sd_aroma = sd(review_aroma), sd_appeareance = sd(review_appearance),sd_overall = sd(review_overall)), 
                        by = beer_style]
question4.means&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing how each beer style fluctuates on our variables of interest (with our overall score thrown in for good measure!), let’s plot our results. Note that I have included standard error of the mean error bars as a sanity check to make sure that each beer’s ratings is not going to bleed into the others’ dimensions. By doing this, we can have a bit more confidence that we are looking at actually has some meaning. This plot shows the standard error on each of the two variables we are interested in, and for the most part it looks as if they are relatively well contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(question4.means, aes(x = mean_aroma, y = mean_appearance, color = beer_style)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_appearance-sem_appearance, ymax=mean_appearance+sem_appearance), width=.1) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=mean_aroma-sem_aroma, xmax=mean_aroma+sem_aroma)) + theme(legend.position=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance and Aroma&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Mean Aroma&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-29-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-iv_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This graph has a lot of beers, but what we are interested in is that top right quadrant where both the average appearance and aroma are maxed out. Let’s zoom in on it and throw in a sizing variable of the overall rating and inspect our graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ggplot(question4.means[mean_appearance &amp;gt; 4 &amp;amp; mean_aroma &amp;gt; 4], 
       aes(x = mean_aroma, y = mean_appearance, color = beer_style, size = mean_overall)) + 
  geom_point() + xlim(4,4.2) + ylim(4,4.25) +  theme(legend.position=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
 # geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean_appearance-sem_appearance, ymax=mean_appearance+sem_appearance), width=.1) +
#  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin=mean_aroma-sem_aroma, xmax=mean_aroma+sem_aroma)) + theme(legend.position=&amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance and Aroma&amp;quot;, y = &amp;quot;Mean Aroma&amp;quot;, x = &amp;quot;Mean Appearance&amp;quot;) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=beer_style, hjust = .5, vjust = -.75)) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-29-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-iv_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this subsection, it appears we have a few choices for beers that score highly on both Appearance and Aroma. The American Double / Imperial Stout looks like a good option as it scores higher on how it looks, but our Russian Imperial Stout has a higher Aroma score. We could start crunching more numbers here to find “the best” option, or at this point we could take off our data science hats and put our psychology ones back on (assuming that’s what we were wearing…) and run some double-blind experiments on ourselves to make sure that our data is actually lining up with something in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;reflections&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reflections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What started out as a fun weekend project actually turned into a really great learning experience. I’ve definitely put a few solid hours into this and have gotten a lot out of it. I learned that my friends actually know a TON about beer and data science, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-lfs.github.com/&#34;&gt;git-lfs&lt;/a&gt; is something I wish I would have known about earlier, and that I’m actually looking forward to doing more blogging in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably have to go MIA for the next two weeks since my General Exams are coming up in early February, but I’m sure I will be back at it come late March. Until then, all I can hope for is that someone who is looking to hire a junior data scientist over the summer will come across these posts and think I might be a good temporary addition to their team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Hire Me (as a Data Scientist!), Part III</title>
      <link>/post/hire-me-as-a-datascientist-part-iii/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/hire-me-as-a-datascientist-part-iii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two questions down, two to go! For the third post I’ll explore the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palate) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the posts before were questions on sorting data, this is our first attempt to make some statistical models. In this case, we’re going to be doing a bit of regression modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to tackle this problem. We could run some basic linear regression models and spend the whole post talking beta coefficients and what assumptions we violated. We could do a linear mixed effects model, then realize that doing so would be a terrible choice (I tried it for the fun of it, bad idea). Or we do a fun non-parametric, machine learning model that is on the easier-to-interpret side. Since machine learning is so hot right now, let’s stick with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;machine-learning-and-non-parametric-models&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Machine Learning and Non-Parametric Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-parametric models make no assumptions about the data. The models do not assume that our points come from beautiful, normally distributed ideal populations; they just seek to find some way to give us a good rule of thumb about what is happening under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, we need to make a model to predict the quality of beer (our dependent variable, &lt;code&gt;review_overall&lt;/code&gt;) based on four different independent variables (&lt;code&gt;review_aroma&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;review_taste&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;review_appearance&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;review_palate&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After discussing the pros and cons of certain methods for tackling this problem, my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabitha-trahan-172471b4/&#34;&gt;Tabi&lt;/a&gt;, the data scientist over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soundout.com/&#34;&gt;Soundout&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that an easy way to get the answer I was looking for was to use a random forest model. Some great explanations about how these models work can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gormanalysis.com/random-forest-from-top-to-bottom/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and since this isn’t a post about how random forest models work, I’ll just note that basically the idea is that it is an algorithm that partitions your dataset into dimensions that help us either classify or predict observations in our dataset based on the variables you feed it. Relevant to our question: the ways in which the algorithm splits our dataset is going to help us figure out what are the important variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before running this model though, we need to talk about a small dependence problem in our dataset. In my earlier post, I talked about how we probably should not just run a model on the data &lt;em&gt;as is&lt;/em&gt;. Last time we found there were tons of NAs in our dataset, that not all beers were equally represented, and that not all reviewers were making even amounts of reviews. In addition to these problems, there was also the problem that some reviewers might rate generally higher or lower &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. Since we know things like this exist, we wanted to account for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest plan of action would be to try and make each of the points we want to model independent by averaging ratings across all beers so we don’t have cases where one person’s influence is spread across multiple beers. We also make sure to only use beers that have over 30 ratings as a quality check. Let’s index out the data we need!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: package &amp;#39;data.table&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beer &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;data/beer_reviews.csv&amp;quot;) &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
Read 69.3% of 1586614 rows
Read 1586614 rows and 13 (of 13) columns from 0.168 GB file in 00:00:03&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Make READABLE unique beer ID
beer[, beer_name_unique := paste(brewery_name,beer_name, beer_style)]

# Only beers with over 30 reviews 
reliable.beers &amp;lt;- beer[, .(ReviewsBeerHas = .N), by = beer_name_unique][order(-ReviewsBeerHas)][ReviewsBeerHas &amp;gt; 30]

# Merge with Inner Join 
beer.reliable &amp;lt;- reliable.beers[beer, on = &amp;quot;beer_name_unique&amp;quot;, nomatch=0]

# Make independent ratings 
prediction.data &amp;lt;- beer.reliable[, .(AvgOverall = mean(review_overall),
         AvgAroma = mean(review_aroma),
         AvgTaste = mean(review_taste),
         AvgApp = mean(review_appearance),
         AvgPal = mean(review_palate)), by = beer_name_unique]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have some better data, let’s fit a random forest model. We are now attempting to predict the average overall rating from our four others measures. We’ll use the &lt;code&gt;randomForest&lt;/code&gt; package and make sure to ask it to include a measure of variable importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(randomForest)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Warning: package &amp;#39;randomForest&amp;#39; was built under R version 3.4.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## randomForest 4.6-14&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Type rfNews() to see new features/changes/bug fixes.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## 
## Attaching package: &amp;#39;randomForest&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## The following object is masked from &amp;#39;package:ggplot2&amp;#39;:
## 
##     margin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;set.seed(666) 
random.forrest.fit &amp;lt;- randomForest(AvgOverall ~ AvgAroma + AvgTaste + AvgApp + AvgPal, data = prediction.data, importance = TRUE)
random.forrest.fit$importance&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##             %IncMSE IncNodePurity
## AvgAroma 0.02441128      210.5021
## AvgTaste 0.09918310      316.1375
## AvgApp   0.01538637      194.8586
## AvgPal   0.05592918      278.5960&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The randomForest object gives us two different measures when it comes to variable importance. The first one, &lt;code&gt;%IncMSE&lt;/code&gt;, is a measure that tells us how much our model’s Mean Square Error (MSE) would change if we were to take that variable out of our model. Average taste here is trouncing the other variables in terms of importance. The second variable, &lt;code&gt;IncNodePurity&lt;/code&gt; gives us a measure of node purity from all of the trees that were used in creating our model. Here Taste again leads in terms of importance, but our Palate variable seems to be close behind. We see this visually below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;varImpPlot(random.forrest.fit, main = &amp;quot;Variable Importance Metrics&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-28-hire-me-as-a-datascientist-part-iii_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result that Taste seems to be taking the cake here is to be expected. Using some of the more basic tools of statistics and data science, we can look at the correlation between our taste variable and our overall, and it’s quite high. Actually looking at our average ratings, all of the correlations are really high!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cor(prediction.data[,-1])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##            AvgOverall  AvgAroma  AvgTaste    AvgApp    AvgPal
## AvgOverall  1.0000000 0.8811997 0.9518908 0.8432381 0.9360091
## AvgAroma    0.8811997 1.0000000 0.9591004 0.8954413 0.9365741
## AvgTaste    0.9518908 0.9591004 1.0000000 0.8949545 0.9742687
## AvgApp      0.8432381 0.8954413 0.8949545 1.0000000 0.9120654
## AvgPal      0.9360091 0.9365741 0.9742687 0.9120654 1.0000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing the analysis with this data presents some strange issues of collinearity. Having an &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .951 for our Overall and Taste variables is obnoxiously high. An &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = .974 for Palette and Taste is also strangely large. If you come from more of a psychology background, you would almost never see correlations this high in the wild; it would be an immediate sign for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The correlations go down a bit if you end up looking at the non-aggregated sets too (see below), but again remember that these values have those dependence and outlier issues with them. Still, &lt;code&gt;review_taste&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;review_overall&lt;/code&gt; are the highest correlated variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cor(beer[, .(review_overall,review_aroma,review_appearance,review_palate,review_taste)])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                   review_overall review_aroma review_appearance
## review_overall         1.0000000    0.6160131         0.5017324
## review_aroma           0.6160131    1.0000000         0.5610290
## review_appearance      0.5017324    0.5610290         1.0000000
## review_palate          0.7019139    0.6169469         0.5666339
## review_taste           0.7898156    0.7167761         0.5469804
##                   review_palate review_taste
## review_overall        0.7019139    0.7898156
## review_aroma          0.6169469    0.7167761
## review_appearance     0.5666339    0.5469804
## review_palate         1.0000000    0.7341351
## review_taste          0.7341351    1.0000000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effect is probably due to the fact that higher quality beers tend to score higher on everything. It would be pretty strange in practice to give a beer a 5/5 overall, but then think it’s deserving of a 2/5 in Taste. If I were on a team at Beer Advocate, I might suggest incorporating either a larger range of ratings (maybe a seven point scale) or maybe thinking about different dimensions to ask people to rate like ‘hoppiness’ or bang-for-your-buck. Variables like these would allow us to learn more about the beers since they would have less collinearity issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the take-home here is that the taste variable is the most important variable for determining the overall rating and again we’re reminded about how messy this data is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <guid>/post/hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-ii/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from my earlier post, I’m now looking to tackle the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty open ended question, which is kind of fun.
I also don’t really have a ton of experience (yet!) in recommendation systems, though I have done a little reading here or there on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goals in coming up with three beers to recommend were to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to find the most popular beer among super users of the website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/IcjSDZNbOs0?t=31s&#34;&gt;bizzaro&lt;/a&gt; beer that matched the profile of my first beer, but lives in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;amp;lr=&amp;amp;id=DTeZAAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;oi=fnd&amp;amp;pg=PT6&amp;amp;dq=anderson+2006+long+tail&amp;amp;ots=MpaGpMbdfD&amp;amp;sig=25QPk_RCCNU2yFoo9nsU0hrt0sc#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=anderson%202006%20long%20tail&amp;amp;f=false&#34;&gt;long tail&lt;/a&gt; of the ratings distribution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the best Beer sans Booze (Highest Rating with lowest ABV)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s begin!
Here’s how I went about tackling this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;popular-with-super-users&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Popular with Super Users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#=====================================================================================#
# Following suit of the last post... 
#=====================================================================================#
# Library
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(stringr)
#=====================================================================================#
beer &amp;lt;- fread(&amp;quot;data/beer_reviews.csv&amp;quot;)
beer.complete &amp;lt;- beer[complete.cases(beer)]
#=====================================================================================#&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having more experience in experimental settings, one of the first things I needed to get used to when I started working with non-psychology datasets was the lack of complete sets in what felt like almost everything.
Whereas in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://musiccog.lsu.edu/&#34;&gt;lab&lt;/a&gt; we spend lots of time trying to design balanced studies that hopefully don’t violate the litany of assumptions that classic null hypothesis significance testing demands, my first few attempts at analyzing large amounts of data made me realize it’s almost risible to think that you’re going to have even, independent data, ever.
This dataset is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all of the unique users on the site, most of them have done only a couple of reviews, but some have essentially made a job out of this.
Looking at the distribution of reviews, this is quite clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;review.counts &amp;lt;- beer[, .(.N), by = review_profilename][order(-N)]
review.counts &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##        review_profilename    N
##     1:     northyorksammy 5817
##     2:      BuckeyeNation 4661
##     3:        mikesgroove 4617

## 33388:            joeebbs    1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hist(beer[, .(.N), by = review_profilename][order(-N)]$N, 
     breaks = 200,
     xlab = &amp;quot;Number of Reviews&amp;quot;,
     main = &amp;quot;Distribution of Reviews Per User&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-14-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-ii_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty important when it comes to modeling the data (discussed in Part III), and not being fully aware of where your ratings are coming from could put the quality of your models at serious risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So looking at this dataset, I wondered if there were any sort of implicit assumptions I could make about this data that might be able to help me find a good beer.
One assumption that I didn’t think was too wild was that a sample of this population that had gone out of its way to rate over 500 beers was probably more of a beer expert than those who have only done a couple of reviews on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I wanted to check was: of all the 1.5 million reviews, where were they coming from? Were there enough reviews among the super users that I could use?
And what made someone a super user?
I could have been a bit more scientific, setting an &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; threshold, but for this I kind of just looked at that chart above, spit balled thinking 500 might be a good number to check, and then went to see how much of the data would be accounted if I put my threshold there.
I lucked out and got about half of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum(review.counts$N) # Number of Total Reviews &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 1586614&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sum(review.counts[ N &amp;gt; 500]$N) # Number of Reviews from Super Users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 731066&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;731066/1586614 # Percent of Total Reviews from 500+ Super Users&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.4607712&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;super.users &amp;lt;- review.counts[ N &amp;gt;  500] # I can settle for .75 Million Reviews&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I had a list of the users who had completed over 500 reviews and made up 46% of our entire data.
I could use this new table I had made to index through our dataset of all the reviews that I had (that have their ABV ratings!) so I was then only dealing with these higher quality reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;super.reviews &amp;lt;- super.users[beer.complete, on = &amp;quot;review_profilename&amp;quot;, nomatch=0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I continued to chop down the dataset (since this was a very exploratory process compared with cleaning up an experiment), it was important to do &lt;strong&gt;quality assessment&lt;/strong&gt; steps.
One thing worth checking here was to see if I was actually dealing with beer omnivores in our super users and make sure that all different types of beers were being represented in our smaller subset.
This was done by just looking at the number of rows between the original dataset and our super user table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;super.reviews[, .(beer_styles = unique(beer_style))]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beer[, .(beer_styles = unique(beer_style))]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;##                          beer_styles

&lt;p&gt;Luckily they were the same.
If I were to really do some more work on this dataset, I would also want to check things such as how many of the beers had each super user tried?
Were there IPA experts in the group?
If yes, should their opinions be taken more seriously if I had questions about IPA recommendations in the future?
But for now, I just set out to see what the highest rated beer among all the super users of this dataset was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to answer that question, I had to find out which beer in specific had the highest mean rating.
The dataset ‘as is’ comes with a &lt;code&gt;beer_id&lt;/code&gt; unique ID, but the data downloaded as is does not give us a key to this, so I had to make it myself.
This was accomplished by just pasting together the brewery’s name, along with the beer name, and style into a new variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another &lt;strong&gt;quality assurance&lt;/strong&gt; step, it was worth checking to see if this recreated the unique ID variable, which it didn’t do exactly… but it was pretty close.
I would chalk that up to some sort of encoding error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;super.reviews[, beer_name_unique := paste(brewery_name,beer_name, beer_style)]

length(unique(super.reviews$beer_beerid))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 42825&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;length(unique(super.reviews$beer_name_unique))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 42703&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;42703/42805 # Pretty close&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] 0.9976171&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;super.reviews.popular &amp;lt;- super.reviews[, .(most_reviewed_beers = .N), 
                                       by = beer_name_unique][order(-most_reviewed_beers)]

hist(super.reviews.popular$most_reviewed_beers,
     main = &amp;quot;Distribution of Number of Ratings by Super Users&amp;quot;,
     xlab = &amp;quot;Number of Reviews each Beer Recieves&amp;quot;,
     breaks = 200)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-14-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-ii_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again I saw this was clearly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; anything resembling a repeated measures experiment and not all beers were rated equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing in the same fashion above, I just grabbed the top 100 beers of our super users and merged that on to our table from earlier that had all of the ratings from our super users.
Then from that table, I took the average of the overall rating and looked at our top ten beers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;super.reviews.popular.100 &amp;lt;- super.reviews[, .(most_reviewed_beers = .N), by = beer_name_unique][order(-most_reviewed_beers)][1:100]

&lt;p&gt;And we have our winner!
It’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/&#34;&gt;Pliny The Elder&lt;/a&gt; from Russian River Brewing Company as my first beer recommendation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bizzaro-beer&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bizzaro Beer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Pliny The Elder seemed to be a pretty popular beer.
But what if I was trying to sketch out some ideas about what other beers I could recommend to beer lovers who like Pliny The Elder?
It needed to somewhat “look like” the target beer, but have way less reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing with some of the fringe data here, I wanted to be careful not to again pick a beer with only one or two ratings on it.
My rationale was coming from assuming there is some sort of true “population mean” for this beer and having a beer with too little reviews will not approximate the mean correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Make Unique Beer Label for Larger Dataset
beer[, beer_name_unique := paste(brewery_name,beer_name, beer_style)]

## Count Number of Reviews Each Beer Has  
number.of.reviews &amp;lt;- beer[, .(NumberOfReviews = .N), by = beer_name_unique][order(-NumberOfReviews)]
 
## Only get beers with over 30 reviews
reliable.beers.list &amp;lt;- number.of.reviews[ NumberOfReviews &amp;gt;= 30 ]

## Join that to our big &amp;#39;beer&amp;#39; dataset only matching beers with over 30 reviews
beer.reliable &amp;lt;- reliable.beers.list[beer, on = &amp;quot;beer_name_unique&amp;quot;, nomatch=0]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our dataset chiseled down to only ‘reliable’ beers, I needed to find a way to get some sort of profile of each of the beers.
While my first instinct was to do some sort of data reductive type thing like a PCA on our continuous variables and use distances from certain scores as metrics of similarity (&lt;a href=&#34;https://musiccog.lsu.edu/davidjohnbaker/papers/Baker_Trahan_Mullensiefen_ProceedingsPaper.pdf&#34;&gt;which I have done before&lt;/a&gt; and it ended up actually being the inspiration for a tool currently used by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soundout.com/brandmatch&#34;&gt;Soundout&lt;/a&gt;!), doing that on so few predictors seemed &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=extra&#34;&gt;extra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead, I figured why not just assume that there is some sort of wiggle room in my hastily made recommendation system and just match first on the overall review, then if there are some close contenders, look for matches on other metrics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next bit of code creates a table of the metrics I am interested in, gets beers that have over 30 reviews, but less than 100, and also creates a vector so I can pull out all of the IPAs on my less reviewed beers table.
I then joined the tables for my candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# # Get metrics used for distance calculations
beer.metrics &amp;lt;- beer.reliable[, .(mean_review_overall = mean(review_overall),
                                  mean_review_aroma = mean(review_overall),
                                   mean_review_appearance = mean(review_appearance),
                                   mean_review_palate = mean(review_palate),
                                   mean_reviw_taste = mean(review_taste),
                                   sd_review_overall = sd(review_overall),
                                   sd_review_aroma = sd(review_overall),
                                   sd_review_appearance = sd(review_appearance),
                                   sd_review_palate = sd(review_palate),
                                   sd_review_taste = sd(review_taste)),
                               by = beer_name_unique]

## Get only IPAs with less than 100 reviews
less.reviewed.beers &amp;lt;- number.of.reviews[NumberOfReviews &amp;lt;= 100 &amp;amp; NumberOfReviews &amp;gt;= 30]

&lt;p&gt;Of these less reviewed beers, I now needed to find the one that was “closest” on the few dimensions I had to work with.
The simplest way to do this would be to just subtract our target beer (Pliny The Elder), from every other beer in our interested list, then check out the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Get metrics for our target beer

                             mean_review_appearance = mean(review_appearance),
                             mean_review_palate = mean(review_palate),

&lt;p&gt;Of course if I were building a real recommendation machine I could start talking about what factors are more important for what users and what factors are more predictive than others, but this seems like an OK enough solution to at least have completed my &lt;em&gt;a priori&lt;/em&gt; goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this solution, it looks like I will have to find myself a bottle of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/&#34;&gt;Pliny The Elder&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/67760/&#34;&gt;Hill Farmstead Brewery Galaxy Imperial Single Hop IPA American Double / Imperial IPA&lt;/a&gt; and do some of my own empirical work to see if this was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Beer sans Booze&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last beer that I think I wanted to recommend would be one that tastes great, but does not have a lot of alcohol in it.
The reason this question kind of interests me is because if we are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; going to talk about how tasty a beer is, it would be nice to be able to factor out of the equation how drunk we are actually getting from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see first of all IF this relationship exists if we look at the mean overall rating of a beer as a function of its ABV content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, when I ran some quick and dirty regression models (that yes, I know violate tons of assumptions) I saw that only a very small amount of variance was being explained by its ABV.
Note that although the models were significant, the R squared values hovered around 3-5%!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This actually surprised me and might be worth looking into at a deeper level another time, but for now I want to keep going on and find a beer knowing that how much booze is in it doesn’t really affect how good it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s take one final dive into the dataset, grab only our quality reviews then plot a subset of our data so I can see beers that have a very high overall rating with a very small amount of booze in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Quality Assurance Step
reliable.and.abv.beers &amp;lt;- reliable.beers.list[beer.complete, on = &amp;quot;beer_name_unique&amp;quot;, nomatch=0]

## Get mean ratings and keep ABV (which won&amp;#39;t change if I average it)
dd.beers &amp;lt;- reliable.and.abv.beers[, .(mean_overall = mean(review_overall), abv = mean(beer_abv)), by = &amp;quot;beer_name_unique&amp;quot;]

# Only Beers that Fit Our Criterion
dd.beers.2 &amp;lt;- dd.beers[mean_overall &amp;gt; 4.6 &amp;amp; abv &amp;lt; 10]

# Plot It!
ggplot(dd.beers.2, aes(x = abv, y = mean_overall, label = beer_name_unique, color = beer_name_unique)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(aes(label=beer_name_unique),hjust=-.01, vjust=0) +
  labs(title = &amp;quot;High Quality Beers with Low ABV&amp;quot;,
       x = &amp;quot;ABV&amp;quot;,
       y = &amp;quot;Mean Overall Rating&amp;quot;) + theme(legend.position = &amp;quot;none&amp;quot;) +
  xlim(0, 20) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(seq(4.6,5,.1)), limits = c(4.6,4.85))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2018-01-14-hire-me-as-a-data-scientist-part-ii_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all OK choices (most of the beers are still above 5% ABV), but we do have one beer clocking in at 2.0% ABV giving us our final beer recommendation – the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1628/8626/&#34;&gt;Southampton Publick House Southampton Berliner Weisse Berliner Weissbier&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;summary&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all of this, I know have three beers to check out.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/&#34;&gt;Pliny The Elder&lt;/a&gt; is our winner for the top rated beer among our Super Users of the site, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/22511/67760/&#34;&gt;Hill Farmstead Brewery Galaxy Imperial Single Hop IPA American Double / Imperial IPA&lt;/a&gt; is a beer to maybe follow up on from our first choice, and then lastly we have the the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/1628/8626/&#34;&gt;Southampton Publick House Southampton Berliner Weisse Berliner Weissbier&lt;/a&gt; which supposedly tastes great, despite its lack of alcohol content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
