      <description>&lt;p&gt;In addition to academic work, I&amp;rsquo;m also often involved as working as a consultant for various music industry projects.
They are typically a mix of music + data science, sometimes with a bit of psychology thrown in.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to hire me for anything from trying to find insight from your dirty data, to making data products, to scientific consultancy, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to 
&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of projects that I have been involved with in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;projects&#34;&gt;Projects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;brainwaves&#34;&gt;brainwaves&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last year I was involved on a project with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://soundscapeagency.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Soundscape Agency&lt;/a&gt; acting as their scientific consultant to help develop music in collaboration with various artists from the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.erasedtapes.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Erased Tapes&lt;/a&gt; record label, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citizenm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Citizen M&lt;/a&gt; hotels, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/wireless_headphones.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt; Headphones.
The project launched in Spring of 2019 and has received a bit of news coverage.
To learn more about the project, check out this interview I did in 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegross/2019/08/22/this-is-the-most-relaxing-music-to-travel-to-according-to-science/?fbclid=IwAR2N_Qdrh7_zpKVcchT8g8kLgr9Nki3geI0HF4wl2diZIMcPVLTrFdGsg9c#57d3a463508d&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forbes&lt;/a&gt;.
This was also covered by 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/224488/artikel.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Danish newspaper Borsen&lt;/a&gt; as well as a couple of others.
There was also a bit of video content that was created that you can see below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;soundout&#34;&gt;Soundout&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soundout.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Soundout&lt;/a&gt;, I worked on a project with their lead data scientist 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabitha-trahan/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tabi Trahan&lt;/a&gt; and Dr. 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas03dm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daniel Müllensifen&lt;/a&gt; to develop a tool that mapped Music and Brand personality onto the same emotional space.
The details of the project can be found in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306374399_Matching_Music_to_Brand_Personality_A_Semantic_Differential_Tool_for_Measuring_Emotional_Space&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition&lt;/a&gt;.
The tool served as the basis for what later became their 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.soundout.com/brandmatch&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BrandMatch&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;audio-branding-academy&#34;&gt;Audio Branding Academy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I presented with Dr. Daniel Müllensifen at the Audio Branding Academy annual conference in Berlin, Germany.
We gave a half-day workshop on tools that help bridge gaps between academics, creatives, and industry minded people.
A summary of our workshop can be found in their 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284721150_Music_Brands_Advertising_Testing_What_Works&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;annual yearbook from that year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
