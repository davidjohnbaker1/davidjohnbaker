abstract = "Improvisational  styles  rely  on  an  implicit  knowledge  of  various musical  gesture,  ranging  from  not-to-note  transitions  to  those  that exist  on  a  more  structural  level.  These prototypical musical gesture are  linked  and  transformed  over  time,  and  are  intertwined  with instrumental  idiomaticisms,  which  are  derived  from  the  structure  of the  instrument  and  the  amount  of effort  required  by  certain  musical gestures (see Huron and Berec, 2009; Gjerdingen, 2009).  This study explores how these stylistic and physical constraints interact in bebop improvisation  –specifically  the  transcribed  solos  of  Charlie  Parker, Dizzy  Gillespie,  an  Clifford  Brown.    The  aims  of  this  study  are fourfold.  Firstly, we aim to replicate the finding of Huron and Berec (2009),  which  found  that  keys  chosen  for  compositions  correspond with the most idiomatic transitions.  Secondly, we hypothesis that an “arc    of    idiomaticism”    occurs    throughout    the    course    of    an improvisation.      Thirdly   this   study   examines   the   most   common structural  schemata  in  the  corpus,  looking  for  the  most  common occurrences   of   temporally   regular   gesture,   which   were   then categorized to create a schema-derived taxonomy.  Lastly, this study examines  the  interaction  of  the  idiomatic  gestures  with  the  most common    improvisatory    schemata in    the    corpus.    Examining relationships between stylistic usage and affordant idiomaticism.  This study  used  data  taken  from  trumpets  and  saxophonists  to  provide  a metric for the relative difficulty of not-to-note transitions, taken from the corpus.  A web-based study then asked self-identified trumpeters and   saxophonists   to   describe   the   relative   difficulty   of   certain note-to-note transitions.  A difficulty metric was then attached to each note-to-note transition in a corpus of bebop improvisations encoded in *kern  format  (Huron,  1995).    This  study  suggests  that  use  of improvisational  corpora  can  serve  as  a  novel  medium  to  further explore the relationship between stylistic and physical constraints."
