abstract = "For professionals with previous business experience looking to begin their journey into data science, this three hour morning session on Introduction to Statistics for Data Science will focus on giving attendees terminology, mental frameworks, and practical advice on learning about statistics for data science. Attendees will leave the workshop with a high level understanding of the importance of using statistics in their data science practice, which will be framed under two main goals: quantifying uncertainty and the necessity of building models in order to make falsifiable predictions about the world around them. The session draws examples from many real-life examples in order to be industry agnostic. Materials for the workshop will be available in both R and Python, but no emphasis will be put on one programming language or another."
