abstract = "Music is made up of many small repeated patterns (Margulis, 2014). Research in music perception demonstrates that these patterns are learned implicitly (Rohrmeier & Rebuschat, 2012), and importantly, they are related to listern’s sense of musical anticipation (Huron, 2006). While research on patterns and music has established how these patterns are related to expectancy and melodic segmentation (Pearce, 2018), how music’s repetitive nature affects a listener’s load on memory has not been explored to the same extent. This paper presents a novel theory of music perception that links music’s repetitive structure to the limits of working memory. I first draw from research in cognitive psychology that hypothesizes that more predictable events are less taxing on memory. Given research in music perception based on the statistical learning hypothesis and the probabilistic prediction hypothesis (Pearce, 2018), I posit that more predictable musical events would be less taxing on memory as a result of more efficient processing. To demonstrate this, I provide both evidence from a newly encoded corpus of over 750 melodies and a small, pilot experiment (N = 15). I argue that a motive’s frequency distribution in a corpus is related to its load on memory when quantified using the information content measures derived from Pearce’s computational model of auditory cognition. The paper concludes by asserting that studying the repeated patterns in music can help inform both work in memory for melodies, as well as music pedagogy. I end by further speculating that similar research might provide a useful theoretical link to investigate interactions between musical memory and the finite window of working memory, and thus help answer questions of musical perception."
