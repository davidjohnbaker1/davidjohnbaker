title = "Turning Your Values in to Value: Getting a Job in Industry"
abstract = "Most graduate students attending SysMus will not end up working in full time academic positions. This is not a bad thing. There are just not enough academic jobs to meet the demands of the amount of students graduating with degrees related to systematic musicology. While those who train our graduate students understand this reality,  their current employment as academics makes it difficult to provide their graduate trainees with up-to-date advice on how to obtain non-academic employment after graduation. This workshop aims to fill this collective void in knowledge by providing attendees with hands-on activities that will help attendees get a job in industry after completing a degree related to systematic musicology. The workshop will last two hours and consist of five twenty minute sessions, each on a topic related to non-academic jobs and academia. They are: Value and Values inside and outside of the Ivory Tower, Online Personas: Twitter, LinkedIn, Blogs, and Github, Networking: How to Make More Friends, Translating Your Work for Industry, Becoming a Data Scientist? The first session will be largely discussion based in order to situate and contextualize what is even meant by terms like “industry” and “alt-ac” in the context of an academic career trajectories. After discussing what is valued in industry, our second session will focus on understanding the importance of having an online presence when applying for jobs. In the third session, we will explore the importance of making connections during graduate school. Following a short break, the second hour of the workshop will first consist of case study examples of how to translate work graduate trainees are currently working on into projects they can talk about in interviews. Lastly, we will end with looking at a list of resources of how workshop attendees can work towards moving towards a career in data science. Attendees of the workshop will leave with a clear, actionable plan they can pursue while a graduate student so upon completion of their degree they feel prepared to apply for work outside of the Ivory Tower."
