title = "What is going on in someone's head when they do melodic dictation?"
abstract = "Teaching melodic dictation involves instructing students on what and where to direct their attention in order to improve their abilities. This process has been formalized by Gary Karpinski into four discrete steps of hearing, memorizing, understanding, and notating, which help students break down the overwhelming amount of mental processes they need to coordinate in order to successfully complete a melodic dictation (Karpinski, 2000). As students’ experience increases, they are able to memorize larger chunks of music and more easily able to dictate music they once found difficult. But what is going on in the student’s minds over the course of aural skills instructions that allows for this growth? This paper puts forward a computational, cognitive model of melodic dictation with the goal of helping explain how students become better at melodic dictation. The model is based in research from both cognitive psychology and computational musicology and incorporates relevant theoretical aspects such as working memory and the structure of the melody itself that contribute to a student’s performance. In this paper I demonstrate how modeling the cognitive decision process during melodic dictation helps provide a precise framework for pedagogues to understand the inner workings of cognition during melodic dictation and can help inform teaching practice. Using a cadential passage from Schubert’s Octet in D Major (D. 803), I walk through an iteration of the model and show how the the model’s choices aligns with both intuitions of aural skills pedagogues to establish the model’s verisimilitude. I then argue the model’s implications for teaching melodic dictation and suggest how combining research from music cognition and music theory can help create a more linear path to success amongst students. Presenting a computational model additionally demonstrates every ontological commitment, thus making it completely vulnerable to criticism allowing it to serve as a point of conversational departure in discussions of best practice for melodic dictation pedagogy. This paper directly addresses the recurring call (Butler, 1997; Klonoski, 2006; Karpinski, 2000) to address the chasm in research between music cognition and music theory pedagogy."
