In addition to all the academic and professional things that you _should_ do as an early career academic, I also am really interested in finding ways to communicate what I do to audiences beyond the Ivory Tower.
A lot of this comes in the form of tweets and blogs, but here are some other projects I have collaborated on that I am particularly proud of.

## Collaboration with 12Tone
