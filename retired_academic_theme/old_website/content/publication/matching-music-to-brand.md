abstract = "Advertising and branding practitioners in music industry are often faced with the task of finding and selecting music that matches a given brand profile to enhance the overall brand perception or impact of a commercial. Currently there are only few suggestions in the literature on how to best match music to brands (Brodsky, 2011; MacInnins & Park, 1991) and these largely lack the ability to quantify the brand-music relationships precisely. In order to create a practical tool for use in industry, a short psychometric tool was constructed to accurately quantify the perceived distance between brands and musical pieces in an emotional space. The tool combines research from music cognition (Asmus, 1985), music and advertising (Müllensiefen et. al 2013), as well as input from industry professionals. The semantic differential tool was created using previous data where 185 participants made 700 ratings of perceived affect for 16 music pieces across the 39 items representing a 3-factor structure suggested by Asmus (1985). On the basis of a factor analysis a set of 15 items was identified that represented the 3 emotional factors adequately. In a second step, new data was collected using these 15 items across 60 pieces of music presented via Soundout's SliceThePie.com interface (N=6005). A confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the 3-factor structure of the tool within acceptable bounds (RMR <.08, RMSEA <.101,) with factors being dubbed Dark, Vibrant, and Tranquil (Cronbach's alpha = 88, .85, .87 respectively). Ratings of music by a brand's target audience can now be compared to brand ratings by industry professionals using Euclidian distances, resulting in a distance score between song and brand. This measure has been implemented by SoundOut as part for their SyncSight research toolbox and allows for fast, quantitative comparisons that can inform choices regarding the selection of music to appropriately fit brand personalities or suit advertising campaigns."
