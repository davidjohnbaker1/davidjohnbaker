abstract = "This paper summerises material given at a workshop presented as part of the Audio Branding Academy's Academy Day on 27 May 2015. At the workshop we presented empirical findings and insights from research in psychology, statistics, as well as marketing in order to contribute to a better understanding of how music works within advertising and branding environments. In addition we presented three practical tools (the Q Methodology, the Brand Music Matrix, and the Semantic Differential) that can be employed to assess music choices in practical music branding tasks. Data was collected with these tools at the workshop is presented and discussed. In a final section we briefly describe various ways in which industry professionals can pre-test the effects of music on advertising and brand perception using implicit measurement techniques."
