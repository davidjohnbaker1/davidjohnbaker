abstract = "Which computational measures best predict how many notes someone can hold in memory? We present both evidence from a newly encoded corpus of over 783 sight singing melodies and a currently ongoing experiment (N = 11, Stopping = 75 ) in order to answer this question. Using a within-subjects design and musical series recall task using stimuli taken from our corpus with trained musicians, this paper will attempt to explain the results from the behavioral experiment using various models that have been put forward by both the computational musicology and cognitive psychology literature. Models we include range from number of items/notes (Miller, 1956; Tallarico, 1974; Long, 1977; Pembrook, 1983; Li, Cowan, Saults, 2012) , to an n-grams frequency distribution (Huron, 2006), to information content measures derived from multiple viewpoint models of music perception (Pearce, 2005; Witten and Conklin, 1995), sensory models of musical perception (Leman, 2000; Milne, Laney and Sharp, 2015), to static symbolic features (MÃ¼llensifen, 2009). We fit multiple models to our data predicting both accuracy and reaction time then discuss our results in terms of plausible cognitive explanations and discuss how insights from cognitive psychology can lead to more meaningful and robust models of musical memory."
