      <description>We’re nearing the point of saturation when it comes to data science blogs. The amount of reccomended Medium, Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, or whatever website you can post to articles that come up on my suggested reading on my phone is unending. Why? Because aspiring data scientists have repeatedly been told that one of the best ways to break into data science is to:

      <description>It’s been two months since I’ve last blogged! In the time since SMPC, I’ve done a fair bit of traveling and officially closed the graduate student chapter in my life. Most importantly, I ended up going back for my Ph.D. graduation back in Baton Rouge. I know a lot of people don’t walk and see graduation as kind of just another prom or wedding industry (it is, don’t get me wrong), but given that I have spent the majority of my 20s pursuing higher education, I wanted to fully experience the ritual that was its ending.</description>

      <description>Next week is SMPC!!! I’m super excited for it (as always), but this year I’m justifiably a bit more excited because this will be my first experience going to a conference as a member of the Executive Board representing the student members of the Society for Music Perception and Cognition. I’ve technically spent the last six years as a graduate student1 and even though I’ve just recently shed my graduate student status and will emerge this coming weekend from my chrysalis as beautiful doctoral butterfly, the feelings of being a grad student larva are still very fresh.</description>

      <description>I read somewhere on the internet that if more than three people email you with the same question, it’s worth writing your answer up in a blog post. Over the the course of my Ph.D I’ve gotten a few questions from younger students ranging from MCCL@LSU lab members to complete internet strangers (mostly because of a very old blog post I did for MajoringInMusic.com ) about pursing music cognition at the master’s level as a means of a career path.</description>

      <description>After a year, my time is now up as a Residential Volunteer Worker at Toynbee Hall. Given everything that’s happened this year (dissertation, travel, destroying my shoulder), I haven’t really got to blog about my experiences at Toynbee, but seeing as it’s been a sizable part of my life the past year, I wanted to take some time to reflect on what I have been up to the past year.</description>

      <description>Things Are Different Now Hello, first-blog-post-since-I-defended-my-Ph.D! It’s wild to think that after five or so years (between starting the the MSc. and the final Ph.D. defense), I am finally done with graduate school. There are no more exams, no more term deadlines, and no more giant documents to write. The last few months felt like quite the pressure cooker between writing everything up, flying back to defend, then doing a bit of travel.</description>

      <description>Background Not everyone might be aware, but in addition to living that dissertation life this past year, I have also been volunteering at Toynbee Hall as part of their newly re-started Residential Volunteer Worker program. The program started WAY back in the late 1890s. The idea was that all the bougie people from Oxbridge would come and live on-site in East London in order to do charity work and help out a bit before they were to go on to do other things like be elected to Parliament and then pass laws and help those that were not as well off.</description>

      <description>Since I am planning on spending the whole day today writing, I figured: What better way to warm up to some writing than with some writing?1 And what better way to get the juices flowing than to write about the wonderful experience that was the Sempre graduate student conference at Cambridge this past Monday.
If you’re reading this in North America, you might not be familiar with Sempre, so for the uninitiated, Sempre or the Society for Education, Music and Psychology Research is a professional organization in the UK dedicated towards bringing together those in various fields of music, but specifically music education and music psychology.</description>

      <description>I obviously could not resist writing a blog post about yesterday’s Google Doodle twitter buzz. I’m not going to try to talk about some of the smaller issues that came up. And tons of people have already said interesting things, but instead I’m hoping to ride the buzz so I can talk about something very relevant to the discussion: encoding and digital representation.
Using Imani Mosley’s blog post as a jumping off point, she makes many great points about what Musicology twitter was interested in.</description>

      <description>One of the biggest issues that I lament about regarding Twitter is how there is so much great information just falling through my feed, never to be recovered again. A perfect example of this appeared yesterday when Will Mason tweeted asking for people to help provide examples of idiomatic instrumental constraints leading to funny pitch choices.
Within one day, there were loads examples of this along with some discussion contextualizing the responses.</description>

      <description>The past few times that I have sat down to work on my dissertation I have run into a writer’s block. Though it is not the kind of writer’s block where nothing comes out. The past few times I have set aside time to write I have had so many thoughts that I have not been able to just stick my nose to the ground and write. My brain feel like it’s on fire.</description>

      <description>Replication Replication. Is it popular and important for research in psychology? Yes. Will reading a replication paper get you all fired up about research? Probably not. That’s OK though, research really shouldn’t be all about new and flashy findings. Every so often we should stop and think about what we are doing.
Today our lab has a new publication “Examining Musical Sophistication: A replication and theoretical commentary on the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index” that’s accessible online that replicates the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index.</description>

      <description>Staying Organized The semester is finally over meaning it’s time to put some serious dents into my research projects. I’ve got a couple floating around at this point, but the one that I need to think about the most is my PhD dissertation. From what I’ve heard it’s quite an intensive ordeal and given that over the next year I need to write a multi-chapter document with a dissertation committee spread across thousands of miles, I think it might be important to try to stay organized.</description>

      <description>As I write this sentence I know exactly how much time until my next break (45 minutes and 39 seconds if you’re interested). When my Activity Timer dings I’ll stop what I am doing, even if I am mid-thought and do something else. Maybe I’ll make a cup of tea, or maybe attend to that unread Facebook message, but most likely get on Twitter. I really have no idea what I will do, but I do know that as soon as my clock is not counting down I am technically ‘off the clock’.</description>

      <description>Since this is my last post in the beer review series, I’ll keep this short and sweet in terms of analysis. Having done all of this, I do have a few reflections I would like to share after doing the One-Size-Fits-All-Data-Science Interview that I have included at the end.
Our final question to answer is:
 Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?</description>

      <description>Two questions down, two to go! For the third post I’ll explore the question:
 Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palate) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?
 Whereas the posts before were questions on sorting data, this is our first attempt to make some statistical models. In this case, we’re going to be doing a bit of regression modeling.
There are a couple of ways to tackle this problem.</description>

      <description>Continuing on from my earlier post, I’m now looking to tackle the question:
 If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?
 This is a pretty open ended question, which is kind of fun. I also don’t really have a ton of experience (yet!) in recommendation systems, though I have done a little reading here or there on it.</description>

      <description>Background I read Medium blog posts on “How to Become a Data Scientist” more often than I care to admit. Much of this comes from a fear that after doing all this work on the PhD and then hitting the Music Theory job market, I won’t fit the mold of the kind of theorist most schools want to hire. Not coming from one of five schools that seem to have a monopoly on the tenure track jobs can be a bit discouraging, but I also won’t deny that having a non-academic job with a regular 9-5 schedule and a decent salary is pretty tempting after spending the vast majority of my twenties in school.</description>

      <description>For the most part, Twitter is full of garbage. But I’m an optimist and a firm believer in Sturgeon’s Law so by that logic there must be some good on it. That good is academic twitter.
While this isn’t a post advocating for academic Twitter, I did want to
1. see if I could figure out how to write a post with some R code in it and 2. share how I scraped Twitter to find active users in the Musicology and Music Theory community</description>

      <description>November is pretty much the worst month for people in higher education. There are too many deadlines and if you’re still in coursework (like myself) you have essays to write, presentations to make, and a backlog of homework assignments to grade. So if you can save time here or there, it’s usually a good choice.
This weekend I was working a homework assignment for my Transformational Theory seminar where we were given a number of pairs of pitch class sets and had to calculate the imultiset for each following Joseph Straus’ 2014 article on Total Voice Leading.</description>

      <description>Hello, world!
This is my first blog post on my fresh, new website. I&amp;rsquo;ve been off the world of blogging for quite some time, but will hopefully be populating this site with all things music and science in the near future. I&amp;rsquo;d like to create content relevant to what it&amp;rsquo;s like to do research in music science and help anyone out who is interested in learning more about anything from graduate school life, to computational musicology, to music psychology.</description>
