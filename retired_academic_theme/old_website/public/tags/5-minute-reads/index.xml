      <description>Background I read Medium blog posts on “How to Become a Data Scientist” more often than I care to admit. Much of this comes from a fear that after doing all this work on the PhD and then hitting the Music Theory job market, I won’t fit the mold of the kind of theorist most schools want to hire. Not coming from one of five schools that seem to have a monopoly on the tenure track jobs can be a bit discouraging, but I also won’t deny that having a non-academic job with a regular 9-5 schedule and a decent salary is pretty tempting after spending the vast majority of my twenties in school.</description>
