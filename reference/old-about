As an **[academic researcher](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/academic/)**, I enjoy asking questions that try to answer how humans are able to perceive and make music.
This typically requires designing experiments, trying to build computer models of what I am trying to better understand, and reading about what it means to use the tools of the sciences on something that at the end of the day is culturally defined.
I have a Ph.D. from Louisiana State University. 

I've worked on several **[industry projects](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/industry/)** as a data scientist, usually in the audio branding space.
I provide both data consultancy and educational services through my private, limited company. 
Please contact me via email if you would like to hire me for work or teaching. 

As an **[educator](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/teaching/)**, I have taught classes at the university level, have worked as a lead instructor at a data science boot camp, received certification as a [Posit tidyverse](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1/rstudio_certification_training) instructor, and advise graduate students.
I also act as an end point assessor for level seven research scientist apprenticeships in the UK.

I also try to **[give back](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/service/)** to the communities that helped me get where I am today.
For the past three years, I served on the [Society for Music Perception and Cognition's Anti-Racism and Equity committee](https://musicperception.org/smpc-arec.html), one of which I was chair.
If you need help with something that you think I might be able to assist with, please email me.
