And if you're a student trying to figure this

If you’re a student trying to learn this stuff and don’t have a background in statistics, often all you have to figure out is the expert level understanding of all this stuff (while simultaneously avoiding all the wrong definitions (CITE) and classic trips (PAPER FREQ)).
At least to me, there is no obvious trajectory or road a student can walk down to understand it on a lower level, build a new scaffolding, then keep iterating over that process until you arrive an understanding that is able to see it withe verything in place.

It makes me think of this tweet I saw a bit ago from Richard McElreath talkign about how little we know about how people learn and internalise stats and how much human resources we could save if we got better at teaching this.
This is just a ramble now, but there’s a lot of work still to be done in this space and a lot goign on now because SO many people are trying to figure this out, especially with this new wave of democratising data science as the demand for data literacy seems to becoming a new norm.

Of course I don’t mean to say that I think we should dumb stuff down and take [DD]()’s approach where we’re trying to make surgery so easy a statistican could do it. The end goal for education should still be masterful understanding if you are going to do it. There just has to be a better way to get it across to people (or we just abandon p values haha).
