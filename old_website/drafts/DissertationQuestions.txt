Dissertation Questions

What do you write about?
	Something popular
	something that will help your career
	something that will help your advisors career
	something that will help other people 
	something that other people will read

	Lesson 1 of Grad School: Be on the lookout for false dichotmies
	Big thing I want to do is ask a good question, then use the right tools to answer it 
	If I can learn a lot of acadmeic/industry skills and build new frienships on the way, why not?
	
	This is especially important to think about given the job market coming up
	And I really don't think that the right model is to think of it as plan A/plan B
	
	One of those ten hours to cut down a tree, nine sharpening the axe situation

What am I planning to get out of it?
	I want to learn a lot about one topic area -- duh
	want to be that one dissertation people cite that has a nice lit review 
	could turn into a book?
	In general want to do reserach that is going to make me learn new tools (stats, programming, theory) 
	Want to really engage with research community
	If point of my dissertation is to try to better build gap between theorists in classroom and memory reserach, have to do it in process
	Would be foolish to think that I'd write it, people would get separate copies, then decide bc they read my work there should be more collaboration
	Will be blogging a lot about it, might be procrastinating, but it's not a waste of time
	
	Vehemently opposed to the scholar in the ivory tower thing, especially w humanities
	want to bring some of ideas of open science and those attitudes to people doing humanities degrees
	not a big fan of splitting science and humanities anyway
	Science has fantastic power tools and a great common language for talking across disciplines (using numbers to model epistomological stances)
	Humanties are fantasitc for first pricnciples and sorting out the starting rules (Niel degreass tyson tweet) 
	
	Big plan of the whole thing is academia is hard, advisor will not be around next year and even if I were to uproot and move to OSU, why have 2 ppl in flux?
	

	
Academia/Industry 
		Show that I can (if given huge resources) answer a question I put my mind to 

Things that I don't want my dissertation to be
	Answer a bad question -- 
	something that is fashionable now
	Magical dissertation creator (a list composer, b list analysis techinique; b list composer a list analysis)
	

What is a good question?
	

Also need to add in all this stuff with the professor is in
