abstract = "The music of Richard Wagner tends to generate very diverse judgments indicative of the complex relationship between listeners and the sophisticated musical structures in Wagner’s music. This paper presents findings from two listening experiments using the music from Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen that explores musical as well as individual listener parameters to better understand how listeners are able to hear leitmotives, a composition device closely associated with Wagner’s music. Results confirm findings from a previous experiment showing that specific expertise with Wagner’s music can account for a greater portion of the variance in an individual’s ability to recognize and remember musical material compared to measures of generic musical training. Results also explore how acoustical distance of the leitmotives affects memory recognition using a chroma similarity measure. In addition, we show how characteristics of the compositional structure of the leitmotives contributes to their salience and memorability. A final model is then presented that accounts for the aforementioned individual differences factors, as well as parameters of musical surface and structure. Our results suggest that future work in music perception may consider both individual differences variables beyond musical training, as well as symbolic features and audio commonly used in music information retrieval in order to build robust models of musical perception and cognition."
abstract_short = "This paper presents findings from two experiments that model listener responses to the music of Richard Wagner. The main finding to come out of this study was that a listener's Wagner expertise could predict how well the remembered leitmotives to a greater extent than musical training. Additional musical parameters were considered in the modeling process."
