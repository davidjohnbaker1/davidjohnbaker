abstract = "With over 500 citations reported on Google Scholar by February 2017, a publication Juslin and Gabrielsson (1996) presented evidence supporting performers' abilities to communicate, with high accuracy, their intended emotional expressions in music listeners. Though ther ehave been related studies published on this topic, there has yet to be a direct replication of this paper. A replication is warranted given the paper's influence in the field and the implications of the results. The present experiment joings the recent replication effort by producing a five-lab replication using the original methodology. Expressive performances of seven emotions (e.g. happy, said, angry, etc.) by professional musicians were recorded using the the same three melodies from the original study. Participants (N = 319) were presented with recordings and rated how well each emotion matched the emotional quality using a 0-10 scale. The same instruments from the original study (i.e. violin, voice, and flute) were used, with the addition of piano. In an effort to increse accessibility of the experimentand allow for a more ecologically-valid environment, the recordings were presented using an internet-based platform. As an extension to the original study, the experiment investigated how musicality, emotional intelligence, and emotional contagion might explain individual differences in the decoding process. Results found overall hihg decoding accurancy using the method of analysis from the orignal study. Unlike in the original study, the voice was found to be the most expressive instrument. Generalized linear mixed effects regression modelling revealed that musical training and emotional engagement with music positively influences emotion decoding accuracy."
