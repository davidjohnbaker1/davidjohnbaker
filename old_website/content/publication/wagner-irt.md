abstract = "In this study we aim to understand listeners’ real-time processing ofmusical leitmotives. We probe participants’ memory for different leitmotives con-tained in a 10-minute passage from the opera Siegfried by Richard Wagner, anduse item response theory to estimate parameters for item difficulty and for par-ticipants’ individual recognition ability, as well as to construct novel measurementinstruments from questionnaire-based tests. We investigate the relationship betweenmodel parameters and objective factors, finding that prior Wagner expertise and mu-sical training were significant predictors of leitmotive recognition ability, while itemdifficulty is explained by chroma distance and perceived emotional content of the leitmotives."
abstract_short = "This paper focuses on using item response theory (IRT) to model difficulty of items both a survey about measuring Wagner expertise and difficulty of remembering items in an experiment on musical memory."
