title = "Symposium on Open Science"
abstract = "The proposed session will provide an overview of the principles and practices of open science as they apply to the SMPC community. The session will begin with an introduction to open science (10 minutes). This introduction will cover the principles of open science (accessibility, transparency, accountability), the practices that arise from the application of those principles (pre-registration, data and code sharing, open access publication), and some of the common arguments for and against open science. After this introduction, we will present the life cycle of an open science project through case studies describing pre-registration, data sharing, code sharing, and open access publication from actual work conducted by members of SMPC (60 minutes). Next, we will discuss the impacts of open scientific practices on academic careers in music science (10 minutes). Finally, we will close with a Q&A period that allows participants to ask questions and discuss session content (30 minutes). The goal of the proposed session is to facilitate discussion of open scientific practices in the SMPC community, and to provide the templates and tools necessary for adoption. We believe that such an effort will advance our field by fostering a rigorous and collaborative spirit of inquiry in SMPC."
