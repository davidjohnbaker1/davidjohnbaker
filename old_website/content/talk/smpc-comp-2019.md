title = "What is happening in a student’s mind when they perform melodic dictation?"
abstract = "Teaching melodic dictation-- the process of hearing a melody then noting it-- involves instructing students on what and where to direct their attention in order to improve their abilities. As students’ experience increases, they are able to memorize larger chunks of music and can dictate melodies they once found difficult. But what is happening in the student’s mind over the course of aural skills instructions that allows for this growth? This research puts forward a computational, cognitive model of melodic dictation with the goal positing a falsifiable theory on how students improve at melodic dictation. The model is based in research from both cognitive psychology (Cowan, 2011) and computational musicology (Pearce, 2018) and incorporates relevant theoretical aspects such as working memory (Chenette, 2019; VanHandel et. al 2011) and the structure of the melody itself. The model consists of three main modules: Prior Knowledge, Selective Attention, and Transcription. First, the model is trained on a corpus of melodies using a computational model of auditory cognition (Pearce, 2018) that derives measures of expectancy based on prior listening experience. Second, the melody is “heard” by the computer and the incoming music is chunked based on the information content of the melody. Third, the model searches for a match within the Prior Knowledge and if found, the contents of Selective Attention are successfully notated. If not, the model truncates the chunk and recursively repeats the process. The model outputs a difficulty rating of the melody relative to the Prior Knowledge and also make several testable predictions about how melodies are learned. Presenting a computational model additionally demonstrates every ontological commitment, thus making it completely amenable to criticism. This research directly address the recurring call (Butler, 1997; Klonoski, 2006; Karpinski, 2000) to address the chasm in research between music cognition and music theory pedagogy."
