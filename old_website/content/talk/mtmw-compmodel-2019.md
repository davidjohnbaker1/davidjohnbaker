title = "What's going on in someone's head when they do melodic dictation?"
abstract = "Teaching melodic dictation involves instructing students on what and where to direct their attention in order to improve their abilities. This process has been formalized by Gary Karpinski into four discrete steps of hearing, memorizing, understanding, and notating, which help students break down the overwhelming amount of mental processes they need to coordinate in order to successfully complete a melodic dictation (Karpinski, 2000). As students’ experience increases, they are able memorize larger chunks of music and become more able to dictate music they once found difficult. But what is going on in the student’s minds over the course of aural skills instructions that allows for this growth? This paper puts forward a computational, cognitive model of melodic dictation with the goal of helping explain how students improve at melodic dictation. The model is based in research from both cognitive psychology and computational musicology and incorporates relevant theoretical aspects such as working memory and the structure of the melody itself. I accomplish this by walking through an iteration of the model using a cadential passage from  from Schubert’s Octet in D Major (D. 803). I demonstrate how modeling the cognitive decision process during melodic dictation helps provide a precise framework for pedagogues to understand student’s  inner cognition during melodic dictation and can create a more linear path to success amongst students."
