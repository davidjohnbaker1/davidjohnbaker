This past year I successfully defending my Ph.D. dissertation _Modeling Melodic Dictation_.
In a nutshell, I was interested in seeing how tools from computational musicology and cognitive psychology can help understand melodic dictation.
In the research I was able to use all the domain expertise that comes along with doing a Ph.D. in Music Theory with the tools and techniques from music perception.
Check out the dissertation [here on the LSU Commons](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_dissertations/4960/) and I also have the whole thing (though not the canonical copy!) hosted as interactive book online thanks to [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

## Dissertation Output

* **First author** on article accepted at _Musicae Scientiae_ replicating the [Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089642) that offers additional commentary on the use of latent variables in music research. We argue for researchers to adopt a polymorphic view of musical ability when creating statistical models and question some of the assumptions that we as researchers make when we used latent variables in music psychology research.
* **Sole author** on book chapter with Routledge in _Companion to Aural Training in Music Education_ scheduled for publication in 2020. 
* **First author** on chapter in _Scholarly Approaches to Mathematical Music Theory_.
* Two **First author** International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition proceedings papers available on my [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Baker45).
