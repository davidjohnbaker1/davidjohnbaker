      <description>As I write this sentence I know exactly how much time until my next break (45 minutes and 39 seconds if you’re interested). When my Activity Timer dings I’ll stop what I am doing, even if I am mid-thought and do something else. Maybe I’ll make a cup of tea, or maybe attend to that unread Facebook message, but most likely get on Twitter. I really have no idea what I will do, but I do know that as soon as my clock is not counting down I am technically ‘off the clock’.</description>
