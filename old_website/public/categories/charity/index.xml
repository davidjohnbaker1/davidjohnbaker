      <description>After a year, my time is now up as a Residential Volunteer Worker at Toynbee Hall. Given everything that’s happened this year (dissertation, travel, destroying my shoulder), I haven’t really got to blog about my experiences at Toynbee, but seeing as it’s been a sizable part of my life the past year, I wanted to take some time to reflect on what I have been up to the past year.</description>

      <description>Background Not everyone might be aware, but in addition to living that dissertation life this past year, I have also been volunteering at Toynbee Hall as part of their newly re-started Residential Volunteer Worker program. The program started WAY back in the late 1890s. The idea was that all the bougie people from Oxbridge would come and live on-site in East London in order to do charity work and help out a bit before they were to go on to do other things like be elected to Parliament and then pass laws and help those that were not as well off.</description>
