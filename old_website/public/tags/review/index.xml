      <description>Since I am planning on spending the whole day today writing, I figured: What better way to warm up to some writing than with some writing?1 And what better way to get the juices flowing than to write about the wonderful experience that was the Sempre graduate student conference at Cambridge this past Monday.
If youâ€™re reading this in North America, you might not be familiar with Sempre, so for the uninitiated, Sempre or the Society for Education, Music and Psychology Research is a professional organization in the UK dedicated towards bringing together those in various fields of music, but specifically music education and music psychology.</description>
