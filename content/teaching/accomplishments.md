Teaching and research are two sides of the same coin.
Just as it's important to create new ideas, it's equally important to devote time and resources to education in order to give others the tools to create their own 
ideas and build stronger communities in the process.

## Workshops {#workshops}

I offer tranings and workshops on various topics on topics related to data science and am open to designing bespoke materials in order to suit your needs.
Recently I become a certified [RStudio Instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/), have worked as a Lead Instructor of Data Science at [Flatiron School](www.flatironschool.com), and have also designed and delivered workshops for [Minerva Statistical Consulting](https://minervastatisticalconsulting.co.uk/).
I specialize in teaching beginners with little to no experience in data science.
