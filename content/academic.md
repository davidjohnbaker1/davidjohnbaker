As a researcher, most of the projects I work on result in either prose, a software repository, or a talk. 
There should be a corresponding blog post for many of my completed projects.

I've tried to group these by my major research interests, but I find the **[tag system](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/tags/)** is much better for browsing. 
If you are looking for a specific paper, please check out the [preprint](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/tags/preprint/) tag or send me an email. 

My **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tigU2AkAAAAJ&hl=en)** page is here. 

Here is a link to my [academic CV as of 5th August 2023](www.davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/ref/DJB_Long_CV_20230805.pdf). 
You can access each open access publication by clicking a the link to it on the CV.
