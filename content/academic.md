As a researcher, most of the projects I work on result in either prose, a software repository, or a talk. 

There should be a corresponding blog post for many of my completed projects.
I also blog about things I am thinking about to keep up my practice of writing regularly. 

I've tried to group these by my major research interests, but I find the **[tag system](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/tags/)** is much better for browsing. 
If you are looking for a specific paper, please check out the [preprint](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/tags/preprint/) tag or send me an email. 

My **[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tigU2AkAAAAJ&hl=en)** page is here.
