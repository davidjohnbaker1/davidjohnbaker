abstract = "The difficulties associated with measuring the complex construct of musicianship have received conseriable attention in the music psychology literature. Multiple measures exist for various constructs, yet the need for careful replication and documentation of the use of these measures remains an area of critical importance. Here, we describe the replication of the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index in a sample of 346 university students, drawn from both a School of Music and a Department of Psychology. The original approach to modeling the Gold-MSI was followed as closely as possilble, and the results replicated well. Issues were noted, however, with the characteristics of the sample, the skew of some of the individual items, and the overal used of the bifactor structure. These findings are discussed in relation to the state of measuring musicianship in the current literature, as well as in relation to the larger theoretical concerns surrounding the modeling of complex psychological and musical constructs."
