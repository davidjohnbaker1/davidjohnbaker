abstract = "The music of Richard Wagner tends to generate very diverse judgments indicative ofthe complex relationship between listeners and the sophisticated musical structures inWagner’s music. This paper presents findings from two listening experiments using themusic from Wagner’sDer Ring des Nibelungenthat explores musical as well as individuallistener parameters to better understand how listeners areable to hear leitmotives, acompositional device closely associated with Wagner’s music. Results confirm findingsfrom a previous experiment showing that specific expertise with Wagner’s music canaccount for a greater portion of the variance in an individual’s ability to recognize andremember musical material compared to measures of generic musical training. Resultsalso explore how acoustical distance of the leitmotives affects memory recognitionusing a chroma similarity measure. In addition, we show how characteristics of thecompositional structure of the leitmotives contributes totheir salience and memorability. Afinal model is then presented that accounts for the aforementioned individual differencesfactors, as well as parameters of musical surface and structure. Our results suggest thatthat future work in music perception may consider both individual differences variablesbeyond musical training, as well as symbolic features and audio commonly used in musicinformation retrieval in order to build robust models of musical perception and cognition."
abstract_short = "This paper presents findings from two experiments that model lister responses to the music of Richard Wagner. The main finding to come out of this study was that a listener's Wagner expertise could predict how well the remembered leitmotives to a greater extent than musical training. Additional musical parameters were considered in the modeling process."
