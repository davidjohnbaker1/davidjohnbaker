A major part of my professional identity is being an educator.
Most of what I teach either has to do with music or science.

A listing of my university level classroom teaching can be found on my **[current academic CV]()**.

I have also given several workshops on topics ranging from R Programming, to clustering algorithms, to recommendation systems.
Examples of this type of teaching can be seen below. 

If you'd like to hire me for a workshop or develop specific materials for you on a topic, [please send me an email](mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com?subject=[Workshop]).
