It's important to give back to the communities that helped me get where I am today. 
Here you can find out how I try to do that.

You can also ask me for help if you need it by sending me [an email](mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com).
If I can't help you, I will try to direct you to someone who can.

### Current 

I am an active member of [Society for Music Perception and Cognition's]() Anti-Racism and Equity committee and have been involved in several of the actionable steps that SMPC has planned to do in order to work towards a more anti-racist society.
You can read about these in the [December 2020]() issue of _Music Perception_.

I also currently participate as mentor in the [WiMIR]() mentoring program.

### Prior 

Here's a list of former activities I've also participated in:

* [SMPC Trainee Member]()
* [Toynbee Hall Residential Volunteer Researcher]()
