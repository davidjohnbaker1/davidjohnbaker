In addition to academic work, I'm also often involved as working as a consultant for various music industry projects.
They are typically a mix of music + data science, sometimes with a bit of psychology thrown in.
If you'd like to hire me for anything from trying to find insight from your dirty data, to making data products, to scientific consultancy, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com)!!

Here are some examples of projects that I have been involved with in the past.

## Projects

### brainwaves

This last year I was involved on a project with [Soundscape Agency](https://soundscapeagency.com/) acting as their scientific consultant to help develop music in collaboration with various artists from the [Erased Tapes](https://www.erasedtapes.com/) record label, [Citizen M](https://www.citizenm.com/) hotels, and [Bose](https://www.bose.co.uk/en_gb/products/headphones/wireless_headphones.html) Headphones.
The project launched in Spring of 2019 and has received a bit of news coverage. 
To learn more about the project, check out this interview I did in [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegross/2019/08/22/this-is-the-most-relaxing-music-to-travel-to-according-to-science/?fbclid=IwAR2N_Qdrh7_zpKVcchT8g8kLgr9Nki3geI0HF4wl2diZIMcPVLTrFdGsg9c#57d3a463508d).
This was also covered by [the Danish newspaper Borsen](https://borsen.dk/nyheder/avisen/artikel/11/224488/artikel.html) as well as a couple of others. 
There was also a bit of video content that was created that you can see below.

### Soundout

Working with [Soundout](https://www.soundout.com/), I worked on a project with their lead data scientist [Tabi Trahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabitha-trahan/) and Dr. [Daniel Müllensifen](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas03dm/) to develop a tool that mapped Music and Brand personality onto the same emotional space.
The details of the project can be found in the [proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306374399_Matching_Music_to_Brand_Personality_A_Semantic_Differential_Tool_for_Measuring_Emotional_Space).
The tool served as the basis for what later became their [BrandMatch](https://www.soundout.com/brandmatch) tool. 

### Audio Branding Academy 

In 2014, I presented with Dr. Daniel Müllensifen at the Audio Branding Academy annual conference in Berlin, Germany.
We gave a half-day workshop on tools that help bridge gaps between academics, creatives, and industry minded people. 
A summary of our workshop can be found in their [annual yearbook from that year](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284721150_Music_Brands_Advertising_Testing_What_Works).
