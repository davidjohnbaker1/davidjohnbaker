All students pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Music from universities accredited by the National
Association of Schools of Music must learn to take melodic dictation.
This skill is a demanding process that requires students to listen to a melody, retain it in memory, and then use their knowledge of Western musical notation to recreate the mental image of the melody on paper in a limited time frame. 
For many, becoming proficient at this task is at the core of developing their aural skills.

## Structure and Highlights of the Dissertation

In my dissertation I investigate factors thought to contribute to how people learn melodies by drawing on my experience from both cognitive psychology and computational musicology.
I am currently in the process of writing and welcome any thoughts of questions on the research!
Below I outline the main goals of each chapter along with methods and novel findings from the research:

* Chapter I: Background and Theoretical Rationale
  + Establishes why tools from computational musicology and cognitive psychology are best suited to answer questions about melodic dictation.
  + Catalogs and taxonomizes features thought to contribute to melodic dictation
  + Argues for polymorphic view of modeling musical ability
* Chapter II: History and Mental Representation
  + Reviews history and current state of aural skills pedagogy
  + Asserts historical questions of aural skills pedagogy can be better understood by recontextualizing them as questions of mental representation of musical material
* Chapter III: Insights from Cognitive Psychology
  + Uses cross-sectional experimental design to investigate individual abilities thought to contribute to tasks of musical perception
  + Data analyzed using structural equation modeling
  + Findings suggest working memory capacity to be good predictor in tasks of musical perception
* Chapter IV: Computational Features
  + Asserts that computationally abstracted features from melodies can be used as quantitative stand in for musical intuitions
  + Discusses how these features can be used to help aural skills pedagogues determine difficulty of melodies
* Chapter V: Dictation Corpus 
  + Introduces new 600+ melody corpus
  + Describes corpus' features and possible uses
* Chapter VI: Experiments and Computational Model 
  + Synthesizes all aforementioned factors in dual experiments investigating how predictive abstracted features are in experimental setting
  + Posits computational model of melodic dictation
  + Discusses how computational model can inform both perceptual research and inform pedagogical practice.
