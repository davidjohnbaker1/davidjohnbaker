Hello! 

I'm Dave Baker and I'm interested in music, theory, and the sciences.
I currently work as a postdoctoral research associate as part of the [Music Cognition Group](https://www.mcg.uva.nl/) at the [Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) an the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/).

As an **[academic researcher](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/academic/)**, I investigate how tools from cognitive psychology and computational musicology can help understand cognition in ways only possible with music. I have a Ph.D. from Louisiana State University in Music Theory and did my graduate minor in Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

As a **[data scientist](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/industry/)**, I solve problems for clients who need someone who can both ask meaningful musicological questions as well as use the right technical tools to answer them.
I provide both data consultancy and educational services which are run through my private, limited company. Please contact me via email if you would like to hire me for work or teaching. 

As an **[educator](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/teaching/)**, I have taught classes at the university level, have worked as a lead instructor at a data science bootcamp, received certification as an [RStudio tidyverse](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1/rstudio_certification_training) instructor, and also give one-on-one support to anyone who might need help.

I also try to **[give back](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/service/)** to the communities that helped me get where I am today.
I currently serve as the interim chair of the [Society for Music Perception and Cognition's Anti-Racism and Equity committee](https://musicperception.org/smpc-arec.html), participate as a part of the WiMIR mentoring program, and serve as the Proceedings chair for the [2022 Digital Libraries for Musicology](https://dlfm.web.ox.ac.uk/) conference.
