Hello! 

I'm Dave Baker and I'm interested in music, theory, and the sciences.
I currently work at Goldsmiths, University of London in the [Department of Computing](https://www.gold.ac.uk/computing/) as part of [TROMPA](https://trompamusic.eu/).

As an **[academic researcher](https://www.davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/academic)**, I investigate how tools from cognitive psychology and computational musicology can help understand cognition in ways only possible with music. I have a Ph.D. from Louisiana State University in Music Theory and did my graduate minor in Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

As a **[data scientist](https://www.davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/industry/)**, I solve problems for clients who need someone who can both ask meaningful musicological questions as well as use the right technical tools to answer them. 

As an **[educator](https://www.davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/teaching/)**, I have taught classes at the university level, have worked as a lead instructor at a data science bootcamp, received certification as an [RStudio tidyverse](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1/rstudio_certification_training) instructor, and also give one-on-one support to anyone who might need help.

I also try to **[give back](https://www.davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/service/)** to the communities that helped me get where I am today.

If you want to see what I'm up to or currently thinking, please check out my **[blog](https://www.davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/archives/)**.
