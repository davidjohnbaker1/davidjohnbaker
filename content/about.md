I'm in a transition period of my career.
I spent the last six years working as an academic and applied (data) scientist in the UK and Europe. 

I now live in Portland, Maine and am actively looking for either:

- full time data science work in my area of expertise OR 
  - music, science, stats, ML, R, Python 
- general contract work in data science and data science education.
