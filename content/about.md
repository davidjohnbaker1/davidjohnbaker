Hello! 

I'm Dave Baker and I'm interested in music, theory, and the sciences.
I currently work as a postdoc with the [Music Cognition Group](https://www.mcg.uva.nl/) at the [Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/).

As an **[academic researcher](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/academic/)**, I enjoy asking questions that try to answer how humans are able to perceive and make music.
This typically requires designing experiments, trying to build computer models of what I am trying to better understand, and reading about what it means to use the tools of the sciences on something that at the end of the day is culturally defined.
I have a Ph.D. from Louisiana State University in Music Theory and did my graduate minor in Cognitive and Brain Sciences.

As a **[data scientist](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/industry/)**, I solve problems for clients who need someone who can both ask meaningful musicological questions as well as use the right technical tools to answer them.
I provide both data consultancy and educational services which are run through my private, limited company. 
Please contact me via email if you would like to hire me for work or teaching. 

As an **[educator](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/teaching/)**, I have taught classes at the university level, have worked as a lead instructor at a data science bootcamp, received certification as an [RStudio tidyverse](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1/rstudio_certification_training) instructor, and advise graduate students.

I also try to **[give back](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/service/)** to the communities that helped me get where I am today.
For the past three years, I served on the [Society for Music Perception and Cognition's Anti-Racism and Equity committee](https://musicperception.org/smpc-arec.html), one of which I was chair.
If you need help with something that you think I might be able to assist with, please email me. 

If you want to see what I'm up to or currently thinking, please check out my **[blog](https://davidjohnbaker.rbind.io/archives/)**.

If you'd like to get in touch, please [email me](mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com).
I normally am very active on [twitter](www.twitter.com/davidjohnbaker), but have been taking a bit of a break there for my mental health.
