title = "Examining Objective and Subjective Aspects of Musical Sophistication: Insights from General Fluid Intelligence and Working Memory Capacity"
abstract = "Recent work in music psychology has examined the relationship between individual differences and factors that predict various aspects of musical sophistication. Some of the recent research has begun to model how musical sophistication or aptitude relates to various cognitive measures, ranging from executive functions, to measures of general fluid intelligence. Recent research has also investigated how differences in musical training may lead to differences in working, short-term, and long-term memory capacity.While some of the previously mentioned work uses continuous measures of musical sophistication, many only collect data on years of formalized musical training as opposed to a more multi-faceted view of musical sophistication. The aim of this paper is to share findings from a large study investigating how musical sophistication,as measured by the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index (Gold-MSI), relates to measures of working memory and general fluid intelligence. Results using structural equation modeling (SEM) suggest working memory capacity and general fluid intelligence explain more of the variance in perceptual tasks than self-report measures of musical sophistication. In light of these findings, we suggest that further models of music perception should focus on modeling what processes contribute to a task, rather than using large,composite latent variables."
