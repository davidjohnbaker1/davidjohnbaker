title = "Modeling Melodic Dictation"
abstract = "Despite its abundance in curricula in music conservatory settings,research on topics pertaining to aural skills is currently limited at best. While anthologies of materials for sight singing and dictation exist, the ways in which people learn melodies are not well understood. This problem is difficult to tackle given the amount of factors that may contribute to the process, such as the complexity of the melody, the degree of exposure needed to commit a melody to long-term memory, and individual differences in cognitive ability that have been shown to contribute to an individual's performance on musical tasks. Fortunately, literature exists in related areas that serve to inform which parameters might contribute to an individualâ€™s performance in a melodic dictation setting. This paper presents research exploring the degree to which individual and musical features can help model performance on melodic dication tasks using both experimental and computational methods."
