Today marks a peculiar anniversary.
As of the 2nd of February, for the first time in my life, I have been at the same job for more than a year.

That's 366 days of full-time employment on a single, albeit temporary, contract.

It's a strange thing to first experience in my early 30s.
But it's true.
After undergraduate, I have either been in school (on limited student contracts), on temporary research contracts, or have got laid off during a role that would have lasted beyond 365 days.

This way of living, as in, feeling like I always need to be thinking about what I am going to do next, has created a lot of instability in my day-to-day and has had a big effect on how I view my relationship with work.
In some ways it has been good in that I have had to be creative and, at times, forcefully pushed out of my comfort zone, resulting in a very unusual and exciting career path.
But the bad part is that I feel like I have had to work harder than needed to mend together my identity as a researcher and my related skill set in a cohesive narrative.
