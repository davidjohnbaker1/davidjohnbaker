Sort of overlooked as good thing in GTD, but you can save everything in GTD.
In capturing stuff, you get things that are not really urgent or important and sort of are stuff.
Aka, papers I want to read or youtube videos I want to watch.

They get captured like anything else.
Though when I clarify them, they just get put in my library as link.
I know its there, sometimes want to find it again, know where to look.

Might never watch all of it, but one day will want some.
No reason not to keep track of this kidn of stuff as long as you know what it means to you.

# In Action, A Result

So as a flow, what happens?

if you do all this, end up with a a central source, outside your head, that lets you know what you need to do wheen.
And if you are also clever, have given yourself everything you need to do in order to accomplish that. 

Below (semi censored) gif of opening emacs, result of rnning the agenda call 

End up with all the information you have to juggle each time you normally want to sit down, ready to work.
And if your healthy and regular about this, all this work ONLY lives in your agenda.

Which means, when you leave your computer, its not with you.
Can actually enjoy your life and not think about work.
Not have to feel there are other things to do
