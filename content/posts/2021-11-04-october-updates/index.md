What's new this past month? 
I've gone from under-employed to working what seems to be like full time, which is a welcome change of pace.

Nothing new on the publication front, nothing new on the (academic) job search front other than knowing that I am now at about the half way point of my current contract. 
Time to start thinking about new (ideally more permanent) work come spring.
That said, I have been doing a bit more work (what has taken me to full time-ish) in the world of data science education.
It's an interesting space to work in because, like all things education, you really have to love education to do it (which I do).

Though I did give a talk at the [Computational Auditory Perception group at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html) last week.
It was my first time talking research since Summer of 2019 and deeply appreciated the insights the group had on that musical, serial recall task I am revising.

Concerning my current position, I think I am in that phase of post-doc life where data is coming in, I am trying my best to prepare for when it does all arrive (writing drafts of the papers, trying to write scripts that know what the data will look like), but it's a slow process.
It'll all fall into place in the new year and might have some interesting posts to share then.

I spend a lot of time learning new things that I don't really tweet or write about on the programming and stats front, but unlike before where I'd spout out whatever was on my mind on Twitter, I am finding I stay on track with my self-learning if I don't talk about it much...

Finally, I am back [teaching and supervising which means occasional trips up to Cambridge](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/) .
The campus is gorgeous this time of year (couldn't think of anywhere more stereotypical to walk around with a coffee between teaching with the leaves changing color) and after this past year have really done my best to try to take it all in.
