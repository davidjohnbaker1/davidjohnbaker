Today we submitted the transcript of the panel that the [Society for Music and Perception's Anti Racism and Equity Committee](https://musicperception.org/smpc-arec.html) organized at last summer's conference in Portland, Oregon.

You can find the [pre-print here](https://psyarxiv.com/qjfpe) and we also have created an [open science framework](https://osf.io/y5jme/) project where you can find the audio transcription (though bear in mind, it is not by any means professional quality audio).

Please do take some time and engage with what was said if you were not at the panel discussion last summer.
There were a lot of really great points made by all the panelists and taking some time to read through this is well worth your time.

### Wanted

While this manuscript will eventually be published open-access (aka anyone can read it and it will not live behind a paywall), there is still one more thing that the AREC would like to do with this project.

As is painfully obvious if you ever talk to non-academics, non-academics (the rest of th world) does not really read (nor should they?) read (or even be able to access!) academic journals. 

This came up several times in the planning of this panel and one thing that we would very much like to do now we have a V1.0 of this project is try to work with some sort of animator or artist who we could commission (\$\$\$) to distill the 30 plus pages of conversation into a short, digestible video that is pleasing to watch.

If you know of someone who might be interested in this, please send me an email as we are starting to look for creators who might be interested in this.
