If I had to describe my orgflow system in a single pass, I think it would be this.

The orgflow system is one possible implementation of [GTD]() using [emacs]() [org-mode]() that uses a [bottom up]() system to help externalize and plan work. Work , as David Allen puts it, is anything in your life that is <work definition>. 

If you're familiar with both GTD and org-mode, there's not really much new for you here.
This post will focus more on the GTD aspect.
Though it's better to just get the audio book if you want this explained properly. 

One of the main principles behind GTD is that your brain is for thinking and not remembering.
If this is true, then we want to delegate _any and every_ kind of "remembering" task to some *TRUSTED* external source.

- needs to capture both structured and unstructed information
- 

What results is essentially a giant menu of actionable items that you _could do_ given external pressures like time, urgency, location, and your own energy levels.
It is a lot of work to maintain this system, but I find that it's 100x better than walking around with the anxiety of not knowing if some deadline will jump out of the bushes and scare the living daylights out of you.

So what does it look like at a high level?

Well its essentially a giant text document that you can search and interact with in sophisticated ways.
It's set up in such a way that I should be able to see all levels of whatever hierarchy I am on without scrolling around.

The document is organized hierarchically, using the following principles for the Headers (H):

* H1: Major Areas of Focus 
* H2: Projects
* H3: Project Files 
* H4: Actionable Items
* H5 and H6: Use as needed

*Major Areas of Focus* divides my work into the major areas of my life that I need to organize and track.
These could be organized a different way, possibly into different documents, but this configuration works well for me at the moment.
Some of the topics might appear to be self explanatory, but they all have a very specific meaning.

_Capture_ is a fundamental GTD concept where all unorganized "stuff" goes before it becomes an actionable item. As I am going throughout my day, if I see something I want to read, or an email that I want to respond to that will take me more than 2 minutes, I copy the link and throw it under _Capture_ to be dealt with at another time.
This header also holds all of my other GTD related information, like tracking when I do my weekly review, and things I want to come across on a regular basis. 

_Work_ is the heading that is related to any responsibility related to income.
For the most part, this is just where I keep my _work_ for my job at the [University of Amsterdam](), but every so often I will do a guest lecture, or some sort of assessment.
I also track here any sort of future work (when I am applying to jobs).

A _project_ in the world of GTD is <DEF, page>. 
Here is where I keep the many "things" I am working on.
A project should have a clear end goal, and under each header, I have written what it would mean to complete this project.
This leads to more actionable/deliverable oriented thinking and helps me from feeling that my work does not have clear boundries.
Not all the projects I have here have the same priority, it's just where they live.

One thing I very much like about the GTD method is that it does not let force you to try to priortize between your work/projects on a longer time scale.
Each week you do a pass of everything and are allowed and encouraged to breifly re-negotiate each commitment you have made to yourself.
It used to bother me that I would have so many dormant projects, but a bit part of that was because I felt I needed to keep them all on the same priority status.
This is totally unsustiable and unrealistic and giving yourself permission to see each thing you want to do each week and just say "i see you, but not this week" has been tremendously helpful for me personally. 

The _Service_ , _Travel_ , _Personal_ , and other categories are a bit more self explanatory. 
Service is what I do for work but am not paid to do (peer review, work I did as part of SMPC's ARE committee), Personal matters dealing with money , taxes, relationships, family, food I like all go here. 

_Reading_ is a funny one since I just dump anything I might want to read here.

Then the rest either deal with archiving projects or information I want access to in working with the orgflow system. 

Most *second level headings* are projects.
As noted above, this is <DEF>.
For example, a paper that I am working on will be a project.
I know what it means for a project to be "done" (accepted at a journal).

Under his H2 heading, you'll see a few things that I track here.

Logbook, emacs way of keeping time on things
Hyperlinks to the online documents (google doc or github repo)

Then the *Project Files* that help organise materials.
And under those are the actionable items, aka the basic unit of work that is needed to move something forward.
Most actionable items are tagged with a TODO.
They also might have context tags, (the location, urgency, whatever) that makes them indexible.

Then below, can have *As needed headers* , aka just when want to go deeper.

Even know, see that there is a a very rich data for when sit do do a task. 

When start, allows you to go to the project, live psycholgically in that world, with access to all essential matierals in project (assuming you do a time blocking approach and think like "its now time to work on this").
Know i am workign because have time counting, which helps split on vs off, aka work towards default being off.

But all these tags, allow for nice indexing.

Can bring up the agenda so I see what I have to do in upcoming 2 week period. 
See what is scheduld for today, and deadlines.

But can also index this by urgency.
For example, use the fast tag for those 10 minutes before a meeting where can think deeply and just need to knock something out.
Or sit down to check for all URGENT tasks.

example

So again, if you've sorted work ahead of time.
Rewarded with menu of what you need to do, work based on where you're at. 
Remove the fatigue of having to decide what to do before you do somethign that is already draining.

This means of course devoting time each day to navigating your capture and process, but this is all part of the GTD system, whearas I am just showing the nice core that I find helpful.

<GTD Docuemnt> 

But this loop is great, what it allows is very clear guide rails of HOW to work when sitting down.
And this loop ends with you closing your computer knowing it's all taken care of.

What results is that this external source, aka your orgflow system, is a little database of everything that you 

If we accept this tenet, then in an ideal world you never will have to remember anything you _have to_ do

- The Orgflow Theory (Practice) 
+ Mix of Emacs and GTD 
+ Basic premise is that no information is held in your head
+ when you get it out of your head, you are also putting in enough work early so when you pick it up, know exactly what to do 
+ Then take advantage of functionality for organising both based on TIME and URGENCY and LOCATION 
+ Ideal situation, you sit down and everything is already pre-sorted by the system
+ So either CAPTURING, ORGANIZSING or DOING 
+ Gets weekly review, point of this is to renegotiate committments you have made to yourself 
+ This is a practice, not a quick trip
+ aka closer to a cult than a quick tip on tiktok 
+ Way to orgnaise your life and work in way that will meaningful change it, get better over time 



+ L1 header: Big Stuff I need to track (for me work, projects)
+ L2: Specific project that can be "completed" , big part of GTD is knowing what this would look like. What is DONE? Example.
+ L3: Where subsets of this go, just organiser. For example, paper might have sections, experiments others, unordered, just to help group
+
