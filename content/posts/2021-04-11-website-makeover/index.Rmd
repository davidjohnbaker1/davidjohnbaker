After a few months of not blogging, I'm hoping to return to writing with a bit more regularity.
I think the trick to this will be trying to write shorter posts, more frequently.

I've also gutted my old design and opted for a more minimal theme. 
I liked everything about the old [academic theme](https://wowchemy.com/templates/), but it just felt like too much to maintain and a bit too overstated.

Lots of new things I wanted to post about in the near future, so either keep an eye on the site or my [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/DavidJohnBaker) if you're interested in hearing about it.
