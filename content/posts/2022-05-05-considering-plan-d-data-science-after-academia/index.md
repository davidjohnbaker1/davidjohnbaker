This week I gave an invited talk as a part of the [Australian Music and Psychology Society]()'s Amplify Your Research speaker series.

The blurb for the talk was:

> Dave Baker will argue for why music psychologists should adopt, learn, and use tools that exist at the crossroads of open science and data science. After arguing as to why using open source software is superior for both the individual and the community, he will offer suggestions on how to communicate research you have done with these tools to highlight the magnitude and scope of your abilities in the context of interviewing for a position in the field of data science.

You can access a draft of the talk here, where I go over all the points slowly. 
The actual talk was also recorded and will link it here when it's made public.
