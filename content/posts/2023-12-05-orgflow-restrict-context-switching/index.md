Above practice is pretty standard.
Where it starts to get more GTD is that there key and essential distiction between what it means to get somethign done.

this can mean 

1. Collecting informaiton / Capture 
2. Clarifying work 
3. Doing work 

Very important to draw lines around these.
this is in contrast to something like timeblocking a project where do all at once related to a project.

As in, decided that from 9:30 -- 11 on Thursday, you will be workign on that chapter, where you then find all the emails of co-authors, figure out whey they want, then do that work.
In this system, could do that if you want, and will really have to.
It's more that also could be in "capture" where scanning all points of new informatoin (email, workspaces, messages) but commit to not clarify or doing it.
Benefit of this is that allows you to never dive so deep that you come up and realise you've lost the plot on other obligations. 

Give an example of each

Capturing, I have a list of all the areas of incoming information. 
For me at moment this is [Big list].
And also note that not all of these are as imporaant.
Much more important for me to look at my teams and work email than slack channels.
So in the morning, only capture Teams and Outlook.
As day goes on, add in other things (which will talk about more below with habits feature of org mode).

so a message like X becomes note like Y. 
If you get really good, might be able to capture and clarify some items.
In that case, might instead look like Z. 

But main point is that you decide where to look when, scan for things that you want to track.
If big priority item comes in, then can deal with it right away.
If not, just keep going.

Clarifying is what makes stuff actionable items.
So have something like MUSIC GENS orgniztional meeting, and that becomes actionable item.
