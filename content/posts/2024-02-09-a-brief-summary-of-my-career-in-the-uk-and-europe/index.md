I spent the last six years (mostly) working as an academic in the UK and Europe researching questions at the overlap of music and science. 
Before I get swept up in the big international move and start thinking about what's next, I want to take time and reflect.
This also will hopefully serve as a nice resource when I start exploring my next employment options.

## Reflecting on it all 

Looking back, I could not be more pleased with the people I have worked with, the experiences I have had, the places I've lived, or the things that I have learned the past several years.
Not only academic and technical skills, but having had the chance to work at such a variety of institutions has really allowed me to see first hand how what people consider "normal" really does not, like whatsoever, transfer well between countries, sectors, or disciplines.
That said, though I loved every second of it, what I did do what unsustainable.
I am ready to not split my time and attention between multiple competing locations, jobs, and possible paths forward in my life.
I want to take a little bit of a break, then continue on in a more sustainable way.
