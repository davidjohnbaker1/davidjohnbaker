- intro motivation, gotta get good at narrative CV.

- wanted to write to normalize how non-linear things can be
- but instead of skirting responsibility of saying so much is luck, acknowledge systemic, but also note idea of career captial. 
- we do live under captialism, not made clear enough even in doctoral training program, pinicle of what people think is liberal
- actually quite dissappointed how conservative and regressive so much of acdemia can be. 
- follow the money, think long term

- thesis on topic that was typcially quite out of scope for department, not nesscarily encouraged, but did get funding for 

Two very lucky things happened in spring of 2018.
I won a campus-wide fellowship at LSU to fund writing my [doctoral dissertation]() and I was accepted to be a [Research Residential Voluntary Worker]() at [Toynbee Hall]().
In tandem, these two financial awards allowed me to move from Louisiana to London that Spring.
I had a very clear idea of what I thought my life in London would look like and could not have been more inaccurate in predicting the next six years of my life.

My goal in writing this post is to:

1. Spend some time reflecting on the last few years of my life before a big move,
2. Give readers an idea of how non-linear and chaotic pursuing an academic career can be,
3. Offer some advice beyond "Oh, it's mostly luck/privileged/systemic factors that determine outcome".


## Dissertation year

Most of my time in 2018 was spent writing my doctoral dissertation about musical memory.
A couple of days a week I "volunteered" in exchange for my free housing in East London.
On Fridays, I would try to join the journal club discussion at [Marcus' group]() at Queen Mary.

Things were bopping along quite nicely for the first few months but then in September of 2018 I ended up getting in a cycling accident (forgot in the UK the front and back brakes are reversed).
I ended up opting to have a bolt put in my shoulder (the left collar bone was about 2 cm higher on my left side since the bone didn't break) and also had a hairline fracture on my skull.
This of course was a giant, unexpected halt to my writing progress and overcoming this type of block to writing is not covered in most standard books in the "How to Finish Your Dissertation" genre. 

After a few weeks of recovering, I of course went on to submit and successfully defend my dissertation (May 2nd, 2019!), thinking I would maybe be able to secure some sort of academic position in the UK for the following Autumn.
This, of course, did not happen.
I did rack up a bit of credit card debt and was at a loss of what to do next.

After expanding my job searching from only using [jobs.ac.uk]() I saw a job advertising a position teaching data science at a boot camp, applied for it, and after a few rounds of interviewing, was offered the job.
Going from a Music Theory PhD to teaching data science is not the typical career parley.

But I think it was possible because during my PhD, knew that intersted in all things music, but also knew that doing music is not something you go into for the money.
As such, spent a lot of my time in PhD teaching myself stats and programming, knocking on doors of other departments like psychology.



- actually quite mad that had to fly out to USA for matts bachelor party and wedding twice 

- qmul
- bike crash
- no acdemic job, flatiron 
- credit card debt 
- 





- writing this because huge part about luck 


In few months time, will be making big shift.
Not only across country, but possibly career from academic to something else.
I used to think it was one or the other, realised work career much more fluid than that.
But regardless, will have to get good at narrative of explaining what I have been up to past six years to Americans.

Goal to show of breadth and depth of work, very interdiscplinary and quite well organized given all that's going on.
And show why it's good to remain flexible, and keep in mind what you value. 

- moved to London in Spring of 2018 when won campus wide fellowship to write dissertation
- Also got position at historic famous Toynbee Hall to be resident fellow, meaning free rent in exchange for volunteering
- Spent year writing up thesis, adopted for short while by Marcus' group, defended in 2019.

- no surprise the academic job market is lottery, did not even get any acdemic interviews 
- but because of teachign experinece and expertise in programming and stats, got job at Flatiron School to be Lead instructor of Data Scienc
- Very great experience, peak 2019 office job, meaning no wfh, incentives to keep you there (free barista and open bar), but this came crashing down since owned by WeWork
- Laid off at start of pandemic, but glad realized that what I wanted back was time

- applied for both data science and academic roles, took 1 year position with TROMPA at Goldmsiths in computer science department.
- helped coordiante on EU grant, lots of writing, but mostly pandemic stuff then
- As that funding came to end, also short post doc appeared again at goldsmiths, but this time in Psych deparment
- in collaboration with SoundOut and old Masters advisor
- So was part time in both for a while, then one tapered off and replaced Goldsmiths computer with consultancy

- some of this was doign brand work with big client at Massive Music, but never launched 
- Other part was doing end point assessments for L7 reserach scientist
- Part of apprecnticeship scheme here in UK, again only possibly because of Flatiron job , having offical data science, teaching, and reserach chops and flexibility.

- As lockdowns started to ease, saw position at Music Cognition Group, was emailed to me by several people.
- Accepted job offer when netherlands was still in lockdown, sublet house in Utrecht for a bit 
- Then later that year, got room in Amsterdam, but went back to London very frequenlty.

- At MCG, post doc on big NWO-OC project where really went interdiscplinary
- primary using games to collect data online, so working with developers, colleagues, students to develop matching pairs as psychometric test
- cleanign web data, lots of R, building packages, and doing it all the bayesian way
- Then big cross cultural project where prepared similar data collection that will happen in summer 2024 in Northern Congo
- Again, balance need of both humanties and science considerations, in almost total opposite
- instead of past two projects with masive online data, how to collect in setting where experimenter lives with and gets to know people over course of several weeks and not about massive data, but how to get it right doing the best you can with what you have, esp given larger context. 

- big part of roles throughout were teachign and service too.
- service as part of arec for SMPC, very happy to talk about the very clear things we accomplished for our group
- when rotated off as chair, this dovetailed to helping out with music gens consortium
- orgnaisign conferences and co-chair of ethics committee when at uva
- helped teach computational musicology class, spotify API with R
- but best part of job was superiving so many high quality grad studennt projects (masters and PhD).

- lest not forget to mention interesting reserach proejcts that resulted form all this, with very quick blurb about all of them.
