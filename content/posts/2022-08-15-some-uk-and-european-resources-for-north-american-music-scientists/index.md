Last week at [SMPC 2022](http://www.musicperception.org/about-smpc.html) I participated on a panel that tried to dole out as much advice as possible to graduate students in the field of music science / music cognition as what they might want to do after grad school.
One area that I have relatively more experience in (keyword: _relatively_) compared to some of my other North American colleagues is knowledge of all things UK / Euro when it comes to research opportunities in our field, but on the other side of the pond.
I fielded one long-winded answer to a question about this on the panel, but promised a better follow-up email, which consequently felt like it should be a blog post for anyone else that might be interested in this question.

## Unit of the Grant 

### Working on Someone Else's Grant

One of the biggest differences (footnote: in my experience!) between what I have seen in the world of higher education employment for non-permanent staff (aka PhDs and Postdocs) between the USA and the UK and Europe (and I imagine Canada too?) is how you basically need to have an established project before you get started on any research.
This is quite different from doing your PhD in the USA, where you are essentially accepted as a 'student' either via a fellowship or a teaching contract or are self-funded to do all the many things required to complete your degree (e.g classes, teaching, qualifying exams, general exams, thesis, defense/viva).
These things of course happen in UK/Euro PhDs, but all to different extents.

For example, in my current role as a postdoc at the University of Amsterdam, I am working on a limited-term, three year contract where the applicants for the project budgeted for both a PhD student and post-doc to undertake a very specific question.
You can see an overview of that project [here taken from the](https://www.mcg.uva.nl/personal/plan.pdf) [MCG Website](https://mcg.uva.nl/).

This model of applying for a grant, then having it fund a certain set of limited positions is probably the most stress free way of working as an academic straight out of grad school.
My last job in [the psychology department at Goldsmiths](https://www.soundout.com/innovateuk-goldsmiths-university-of-london-soundout-project-implicit-impact-of-music) as well as [work on the TROMPA project via the computing department at Goldsmiths](https://trompamusic.eu/) were also this type of job.

Many UK and EU projects follow this model and if you're interested in just seeing what is out there, check out both [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/) and sign up some of these list-servs that seem relevant to your interests:

* ISMIR → community@ismir.net → https://groups.google.com/a/ismir.net/g/community 
* MEI → mei-l@lists.uni-paderborn.de → https://lists.uni-paderborn.de/mailman/listinfo/mei-l 
* Musiology All → MUSICOLOGY-ALL@JISCMAIL.AC.UK → https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=musicology-all
* DMRN → DMRN-LIST@JISCMAIL.AC.UK → https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe

* Music and Science → MUSIC-AND-SCIENCE@JISCMAIL.AC.UK → https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe
* Auditory List Serv → http://www.auditory.org/

Subscribing to all these list-servs will destroy your inbox, so it's worth making like a separate tab or filter for all of these...

### Working on Your Own Project/Grant

Working as a part of an already up-and-running project is not the only option of course.
You can also pitch and propose your own project.

This of course requires _a lot_ more forward thinking (like at least a year to be safe), so if you are a PhD student now, it's worth starting to both browse and see what is out there now and then once you have an idea, send out some introduction emails (more on that below).

The very, very rough way it works is that you find some sort of funding source (be that a funding agency like [Leverhulme](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships), a location where you might want to work such as [The Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/)) and attempt to triangulate a project that connects what you are interested in with the interests of your funding source.

You of course also have to write a killer/competitive funding application that will get selected.

Like picking a Masters or PhD advisor, the best shout here is ideally find some location or group of researchers with shared interest in your project.
If you think about things from the point of view of the location you are going to work for, the group or individual that you are going to work with is going to be a lot more personally invested in helping you navigate the application and your time there if there is some sort of congruity in the field of research.

I have heard of people who just apply on a great project, then kind of just use the resources of the institution to do their own thing, which is also possible. 

So given that, my advice would be to:

1. Have some sort of idea of what your *ideal* project would be (sketch it out!)
2. Find funding bodies that would be appropriate for this type of work (put the research chops to use)
3. Contact the relevant people with your general project idea, possible ideas of sources for funding, and some sort of clear project proposal and float the idea past them.

Ideally after step 1, you can go to your current PhD supervisor and ask them if they know anyone who might do this kind of work and hopefully after doing an entire PhD on a topic there might be one or two working academics who you would love to collaborate with... which is a long winded way to say that much of these suggestions of who to work with next and where the funding come from can come from word-of-mouth or other people who have done something like what you envision.

Some people you end up contacting might be interested in helping your flesh out your rough idea.
If they do that (and even suggest changing it a lot), I would take that as a good sign in that they are personally interested in your project and want to see it succeed.
Some people might just say that you should go for it and cross your fingers it gets accepted. 
If you get no response whatsoever, that's probably a red flag.

There are several funding sources I am aware of in the UK and Europe that do fund this type of thing and I am positive that someone else has collated a better list than me (also if anyone reading this knows ones I could add that are not temporary, more than happy to add them here for posterity!), but there are enough below that kind of let you have an idea of the time frames

Here are a list of funding sources that I have heard people get recently within our field, but there are many more.

* [Marie Curie](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) Which helps you cultivate new skills abroad, recently awarded to a fellow music and science researcher [Caitlyn Trevor](https://www.caitlyntrevor.com/marie-curie-action-emusig)
* [Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/early-career-fellowships)
* [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships/)
* [Fulbright Fellowship](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/5914)

I also know that the Oxbridge groups sometimes have money set aside for PhDs, maybe some post-doc work, but it's really a matter of having a pretty clear idea of what *you* might want to do ahead of time, what *they* do, then getting in touch with someone like the director of the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-peter-harrison) very early and articulating why this might be good fit for a future collaboration after reading about what they are interested in. 


## More Ideas

The other places to check out for our field of music and science are the very big centers that seem to have a lot of funding capabilties (as evidenced by the size of the groups/publications) might include:

* [Max Plack Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html)

Which (as of writing in 2022) have three departments:

* [Language and Literature](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/department-of-language-and-literature.html)
* [Music](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/department-of-music.html)
* [Cognitive Neuropsychology](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/departmentof-cognitive-neuropsychology.html)

That further subdivide into:

* [Histories of Music, Mind, and Body](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-histories-of-music-mind-and-body.html?no_cache=1)
* [Computational Auditory Perception](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-computational-auditory-perception.html)
* [Neural and Environmental Rhythms](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neural-and-environmental-rhythms.html)
* [Neurocognition of Music and Language](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neurocognition-of-music-and-language.html)
* [Neural Circuits, Consciousness, and Cognition](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neural-circuits-consciousness-and-cognition.html)

I'd check out each group, their recent publications, and get in touch with the group leaders if what they are working on interests you. 

* [RITMO](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/)

Is a very large group out of the University of Oslo has been posting tons of very cool looking positions recently. 

* [DCML @ EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dcml/)

Is run by [Martin Rohrmeier](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dcml/lab/) and they do a lot of computational theory / history work.
Again, take a look at their recent publications and email some of the authors that still appear to be active in the group. 

If someone is reading this and I didn't list your group and you think it should be on this post, please get in touch, I will add it. 
I wrote the draft of this post on an overnight flight back to Europe and most certainly have peppered it with errors.

## TLDR

The long story short is there are places to fund work after your PhD in Europe (and a lot of this advice is similar if you are looking for a PhD), but the the best way to be lucky enough to get said funding is to do a lot of prep work both in terms of knowing what is out there in terms of funding and how that aligns with what you want to do.
