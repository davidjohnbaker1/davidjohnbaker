I've have the pleasure of spending  the last two weeks traveling for work.
Last week I was at the first in-person meeting of the [Musicality and Genomics Consortium](https://www.mcg.uva.nl/musicgens2022/index.html) in Trento, Italy and this week I was at the [EPFL Workshop on Representing Harmony](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/dcml/workshops/representing-harmony/).
The former I helped organize and the latter I was a participant. 

Though each couldn't be further apart in terms of content, the common thread was that both groups sought to tackle a research question that simply could not be answered using the lone scholar in the tower approach.
There's not as much to report on at the moment, but after so much discussion the past few weeks, there will be a lot incoming soon!
