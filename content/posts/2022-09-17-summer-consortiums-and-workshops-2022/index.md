I've have the pleasure of spending  the last two weeks traveling for work.
Last week I was at the first in-person meeting of the [Musicality and Genomics Consortium]() in Trento, Italy and this week I was at the [EPFL Workshop on Representing Harmony]().
The former I helped organize and the latter I was a participant. 

Though each couldn't be further apart in terms of content, the common thread was that both groups sought to tackle a research question that simply could not be answered using the lone scholar in the tower approach.
To either begin to look for some sort of genetic architecture that might map to facets of musicality or arrive at a general, formal, computational framework for capturing most of what people mean when they refer to "harmony" just could not be accomplished without pooling resources.

I feel quite excited to (after what I hope to be a very unplugged weekend) keep the ball rolling on all this over the next few months and might even have energy now to tweet and blog about it all (now that many of my bigger services roles are winding down). 

Nothing of substance to report on, but maybe include a few very beautiful pictures.
