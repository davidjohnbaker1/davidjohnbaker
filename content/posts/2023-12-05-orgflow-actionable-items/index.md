During clarify, you turn stuff into actionable item.
This is the fundamental unit of work.

All items must have following

- TODO tag (for indexing) 
- short sentence of what it means for it to be done 
- priority 
- context tags
- time tags

The TODO is the item's current status. 
Meaning, it is not done yet.
In Org mode, this can be changed to WAITING (as in, it's on someone else's plate, not done, but you might want to check in on it at some time later) or DONE.

The short sentence of what it means to be done is exactly that.
Concise description of final, desired, finished state.
Should not abuse this and write soemthing like 'write paper'.
That is not possible to do in one sitting, really that is a project. 

For Priority, A is urgent, B is basically everything, and C is stuff that would be nice to do one day.
I don't use the urgent/important grid because if something is not urgentn or not important, I really don't think I have TODO it.
More like a reference item, which will discuss below. 

Context also comes from GTD.
The ones I find helpful are

1. time context
2. energy context 

Time context is where you estimate how long soemthing takes.
Don't fall into trap of thinking this is like 4 minutes or 29 minuets or 45.
The best bins are 5 minutes, 20 minutes, and 2 hours for items that can atually get done.

For energy, also have three bins.
Brain dead meaning could do this if I was sick.
Robotic, meaning, know how to do it, just need time and put on some music.
Experimental, meaning, no idea how long this will take or how hard it will be (programming in another language, reading a paper outsde of music or psychology) 

Benfit of having these is then when finally do get menu of items, if only have a few minutes or no energy, can just grab these items in search.

You can also of course give yourself schedulded and deadline items.
But WARNIGN is that you should not use this to say when you WANT to do something.
if going to do a deep work time block, gotta respect it.
for GTD, the diary is sacred ground.
Don't book anything in that you will not  commit to !!!!!
I found this super hard at first, but is very worht it when you get it.

Only tiem I might abuse this is when out and about and want to capture soemthing, will make note event for next day on google cal.
So i see it, capture it, then delete it. 

Also good to give yourself direct access in terms of links to accompish the task.

If that's responding to an email, you link to the email.
If workign on issue on github, link to the issue.

Seems tedious, but emacs shortcuts make this very fast.

- go to webiste iwth issue then

- Comand L
- Command C
- command tab 
- C-c Cl Cy

Less than five seconds, well worth it to keep your mental desktop clean. 
  
There is also ability in org mode with cpature to also get thse as they come in

Here is gif of myself doing this with new item
