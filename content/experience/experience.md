My name is David John Baker, I'm an interdisciplinary researcher and educator.
I just finished up working as a Lead Instructor of Data Science at [Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) in London, England where I combined my love of research, programming, and teaching to help students succeed as they learn the skills they need in order to begin a new career.

<img src="students.jpg" class="center-block"><figcaption>Our First London Data Science cohort</figcaption>

Prior to working at Flatiron School, I completed my Ph.D in Music Theory at [Louisiana State University](https://www.lsu.edu/) and also hold an MSc. from Goldsmiths, University of London in [Music, Mind and Brain](https://www.gold.ac.uk/pg/msc-music-mind-brain/) and a B.M. from [Baldwin Wallace University](https://www.bw.edu/schools/conservatory-music/) in Instrumental Performance.

I'm a card-carrying [music theorist](https://societymusictheory.org/) who likes to [publish research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tigU2AkAAAAJ&hl=en) in psychology journals and currently work in the world of data science education. 

As a researcher, I feel most at home working between disciplines and think the best questions to be asked come from either questioning fundamental assumptions people hold about how we see the world or taking a clear, action-based approach to solving a specific question.
Most of the research I find personally meaningful happens when trying to investigate musical cognition with scientific methods and taking time to think about what it means to work between [the two cultures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Cultures). 

Combining critical thinking about problems with practical ways of questioning assumptions fits nicely within the world of [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). 
In my current role, I teach students looking to change their careers how to ask meaningful questions about the world around them whilst teaching them practical tools to further explore those questions. 

Thanks for being interested in me!
