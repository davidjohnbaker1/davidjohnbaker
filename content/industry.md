In addition to pursuing academic questions that are known for their often very lofty and loosely defined end goals, I also work on industry projects to meet the direct needs of clients.

These have ranged from small, one-off consultancies, to contract work with international branding agencies, to more permanent positions working alongside companies.

I've also done by best to try to catalog helpful advice for younger academics looking to break into this world via blog posts and workshop materials I have developed and given to various groups. 
You'll find these materials below. 

If you'd like to hire me as a consultant on an upcoming project, please [email me](mailto:davidjohnbaker1@gmail.com?subject=[Consultancy%20Inquiry]).

Below is a sampling of the types of projects I am currently or have worked on: 

* [Music For Brainwaves]()

* [Matching Brand Identity to Music]()

* [Testing What Works Audio Branding Workshop]()

* [Values to Value Slide Deck for Early Career Academics]()
