Outside of my academic work I am sometimes involved in projects related to **data science education** and **consultancy in audio branding**.

## Data Science Education 

For the past few years, I have been involved in both the teaching and assessing in the area of data science in academic contexts.
This began after teaching as Lead Instructor of Data Science at Flatiron School in London for a year.
During this time I was certified as an [RStudio tidyverse instructor](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).

Currently, I serve as an end point assessor for Level 7 (Master's) Research Scientist apprenticeships for [Doran Scott Williams](www.dsw.co.uk) where I also created the assessment criteria used by DSW.

## Audio Branding 

For the past several years I have worked on many projects related to audio branding.
This has ranged from 

* publishing academic articles that answer questions such as 
  + "What makes an audio logo memorable?" 
  + "To what extent can music change how a customer views an advertisement?"
* acting as scientific lead on science centered branding projects

Clients that I have worked with include MassiveMusic, CitizenM Hotels, Bose, Soundout, and GSK. 

## Getting Inovled 

I've also done by best to try to catalog helpful advice for younger academics looking to break into this world via blog posts and workshop materials I have developed and given to various groups. 
You'll find these materials below.
