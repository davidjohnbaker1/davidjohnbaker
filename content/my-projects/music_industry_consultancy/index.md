### Soundout

Working with [Soundout](https://www.soundout.com/), I worked on a project with their lead data scientist [Tabi Trahan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabitha-trahan/) and Dr. [Daniel Müllensifen](http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas03dm/) to develop a tool that mapped Music and Brand personality onto the same emotional space.
The details of the project can be found in the [proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Music Perception and Cognition](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306374399_Matching_Music_to_Brand_Personality_A_Semantic_Differential_Tool_for_Measuring_Emotional_Space).
The tool served as the basis for what later became their [BrandMatch](https://www.soundout.com/brandmatch) tool. 

### Audio Branding Academy 

In 2014, I presented with Dr. Daniel Müllensifen at the Audio Branding Academy annual conference in Berlin, Germany.
We gave a half-day workshop on tools that help bridge gaps between academics, creatives, and industry minded people. 
A summary of our workshop can be found in their [annual yearbook from that year](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284721150_Music_Brands_Advertising_Testing_What_Works).
