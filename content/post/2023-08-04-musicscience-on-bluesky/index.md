During my lunch breaks this week, I figured out how to set up a #musicscience feed on Bluesky.

If you go over to the My Feeds section on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/) and search for #musicscience you'll see something that looks like this:

{{< resize-image src="bsms.png" alt="" >}}

If you add this to your feed, it should then show up as a sort of "channel" on your main page.

What is slick about this, as opposed to hashtags, is that since these feeds are set up by one person (me in this case), they can be moderated and more bespoke than a list or something.

In practice, that means that not only will tweets with the #musicscience hashtag show up on this, but I have also added things like 'musicscience' and 'icmpc17' to also be collected here.
There is also the option to add users to this and even ban users from it. 

Eventually I will better link it with the [repo I used to get it going](https://github.com/davidjohnbaker1/bsky-musicscience) so others can make pull requests for it (what's on the repo is not on the server), but it will do for now.

If you like all things #musicscience on Twitter, please come join over to BlueSky!
