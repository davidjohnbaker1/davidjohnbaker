Yesterday I had the pleasure of giving a talk as part of the [Centre for Music and Science](https://cms.mus.cam.ac.uk/) seminar series at the University of Cambridge.
The first half of the talk focused mostly on on-going work we are doing at the Music Cognition Group, thinking about how we can best collect musical memory data from wide and diverse groups of people.
This was mostly my own take on the research that [we presented this year in Japan at ICMPC](https://jsmpc.org/ICMPC17/).

Since the CMS is based in a music department, I also shared some older research from the good old melodic dictation work that has yet to see the light of day in a formal way.
I thought committing to sharing this work would help me get it out the door again, but alas, the only path to getting a task done is only doing that task.
But actually getting to talk about it for a bit did remind me of the enthusiasm I have for the project. 

That said, I used the talk to finally take [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for a spin and I am totally sold on it.
Would even consider swapping from blogdown to Quarto after the past few weeks. 

More than happy to share the slides or the recording for those who were interested in this.
