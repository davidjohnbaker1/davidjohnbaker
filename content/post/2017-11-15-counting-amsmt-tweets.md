For the most part, Twitter is full of garbage.
But I'm an optimist and a firm believer in [Sturgeon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) so by that logic there must be some good on it.
That good is academic twitter.

While this is not a post meaning to talk about how great academic twitter is, I did want to write a quick post to 
1. see if I could write a blog post using blogdown's markdown and
2. share how I scraped twitter to find active users in the Musicology and Music Theory community

So here it goes...

The first thing that you have to do is get some tweets.
Luckily there are some great packages out there in the #rstats world that can help with this.
For this project I used the [twitteR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/twitteR/twitteR.pdf) package which lets you log into Twitter's API.
There are already some great instructions on how to get started with it that you can find [here](https://davetang.org/muse/2013/04/06/using-the-r_twitter-package/), so I won't go into tons of detail about some of that code is doing.
Also you can't just copy and paste my code since it requires credentials from your own Twitter account.
