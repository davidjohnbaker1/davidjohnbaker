For those who have yet to hear the news, in the next few weeks I will be moving back to the USA.
I resigned from my postdoc late last year and my final day of work at the [UvA](https://www.uva.nl/en) will be March 1st.

Choosing to end my contract pre-maturely was done entirely for personal reasons; splitting my time between Amsterdam (work) and London (fianc√©e) basically took its toll in the end.
I will really miss my colleagues at the [music cognition group](https://www.mcg.uva.nl/), the research, and all things Amsterdam.

As you might imagine, there's a lot on my plate at the moment, so I won't go into detail regarding our future plans.
The general idea is to return to Milwaukee for several weeks, take a bit of a breather, then Evelyn and I will head out to the East Coast (where we've always wanted to end up).

I'll be stepping back from a lot of my other responsibilities and communication channels once I am off my full-time contract so I can properly re-charge for whatever is next.

If you'd like to help me out, [please write a nice reccomendation for me on my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-john-baker-phd/).
I imagine that'll be quite helpful when it comes time to apply for work.
Always happy to return the favor as well.
