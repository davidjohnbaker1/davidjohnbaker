Hello, world! 

This is my first blog post on my fresh, new website.
I've been off the world of blogging for quite some time, but will hopefully be populating this site with all things music and science in the near future.
I'd like to create content relevant to what it's like to do research in music science and help anyone out that is interested in learning more about anything from graduate school life, to computational musicology, to music psychology. 

Thanks again for visiting for now and hope to see you soon!
