Again, many levels to have reguarly sheduled things, all in org mode.

At daily level, have four things.
Morning capture of UvA realted, afternoon of others, and end of day of others.
When on top of stuff, this really prevents falling behind. 

At the end of the day, if get all this done, get shutdown one.
And then do a big, singular clap, and it feels great because know I can walk away. 

At weekly level, gotta have weekly review, can read about in GTD.

And current area of experimentation in whole stystem here is the larger scale planning.
Meaning at the quarter, year, and multi-year level.
I don't really feel like an expert on this yet, so will not write about it.

But this is a gif of me crossing osoemthing off with the org mode stuff
