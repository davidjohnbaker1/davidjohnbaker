<p>After a few months of not blogging, I’m hoping to return to writing with a bit more regularity.
I think the trick to this will be trying to write shorter posts, more frequently.</p>
<p>I’ve also gutted my old design and opted for a more minimal theme.
I liked everything about the old <a href="https://wowchemy.com/templates/">academic theme</a>, but it just felt like too much to maintain and a bit too overstated.</p>
<p>Lots of new things I wanted to post about in the near future, so either keep an eye on the site or my <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidJohnBaker">twitter feed</a> if you’re interested in hearing about it.</p>
