After reading this article in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/) I think it's time to jump ship on Twitter.

I don't want to be associated with a platform where the owner openly entertains the conspiracy theories that are radicalizing the older generation.
I don't want to be associated with a platform where an openly anti-queer, anti-education candidate decides to announces his run for president.
If it's not good enough for [NPR it's not good enough for me](https://www.npr.org/2023/04/12/1169269161/npr-leaves-twitter-government-funded-media-label). 

Maybe Twitter will go under during Musk's watch, it'll re-emerge, then I'll re-engage with it.

In the mean time, you can find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/) at `@davidjohnbaker.bsky.social`.

Why BlueSky and not Mastodon or Threads? 
I don't know, I just have a good feeling about BlueSky.

I think BlueSky members regularly get invites, so if you want to join me there, just get in touch.
Over the next few months, I will check in on Twitter here or there, but I am hoping that come late Autumn I will have fully migrated.

For those in the #musicscience community, I think I will exclusively post about [ICMPC17](https://jsmpc.org/ICMPC17/) and all things research over there.
I really enjoy Twitter-style apps for seeing new publications, watching conferences go by, seeing discussions on various topic, and providing a way for new people to join the community.
I am pretty sure I can have all of that on a platform that is not Twitter.
