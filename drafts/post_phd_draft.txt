## Things are different  

Hello, first blog post since I defended my Ph.D!
It's wild to think that after six or so years (between starting the the MSc. and the final Ph.D. defense), I am finally done with graduate school.
There are no more exams, no more term deadlines, and no more giant documents to write.
The last few months felt like quite the pressure cooker between writing everything up, flying back to defend, then doing a bit of travel.
And now after the sprint at the end of the marathon, things are categorically different now.
It kind of feels like that one scene in Intersteller where everything was building up and then just goes silent and I feel a bit caught in suspended animation and have a lot of thoughts swirling around and no structure to place them within. 

## What to do 

And what's a boy with a lot of feeligns in 2019 to do? 
Start a podcast.

Just kidding, the last thing the world needs is another dude telling you his opinions on a podcast.
I am not starting a podcast. 
But I do want to start to air out a lot of my thoughts on the internet.
In this post, I want to do a bit of self justification of that.

## Set stage of current feelings 

So as noted above, I'm finally done with the Ph.D. (Yippe!)
It was a trudge to say the least.
Not only was it a lot of work, but living in that work environment for six years as an intellectual underling has not been the best of times. 
The hours and pay are not great if you think about the Ph.D. like a job, but more importantly the grind of graduate school is not sustainable.
The rate that I was working in the months leading up to my dissertation submission consumed every part of my life.
Having spent so much time on my #bigsit and all the graduate school that lead up to that, I also was starting to feel a deeper dread that large portions of my life were passing me by and I was loosing time that I could not get back.^[Also add in a bit of fear that everyone that I talked to that left academia willingly said doing so was one of the best choices they've made in their life]
The good news is retrospectivly, I don't regret any of it and as a result; I have a dissertation that I am very proud of on many levels.
But I also think that it is very important to acknowledge those feelings and then reflect on them.
And one thing that really helped me while I was a graduate student was reading about others who seem to have similar feelings.
So what I want to do here is talk about those thoughts and feelings. 

## Thoughts and Feelings

What I am finding is there are a lot of those thoughts and feelings post-PhD.
In drafting this post ,I found that I wanted to talk about EVERYTHING.
For this post alone, I thought about having sub-section/digresssions that talked about, finding personal validation through the structure of academia, feeling disconnected from academic peers as somone not going on to some fancy TT job this year, all the strange things people said at conferences last month, and this list goes on.
And in making each one of those lists, I realized here I had mountains of thougths and feelings.
It was almost like that for every new fact I had learned in grad school, I was given two feelings to go along with it. 

But given all these feelings, and no academic cohort anymore, who can I then share all these niche thoughts with?
This question becomes even more imporant when you consider that you really only are who you think you are in relation to other people.
I noticed this the most when I moved to London last year and didn't have daily access to my cohort at LSU.
You don't realize that you're the "that guy" of your group until you leave them. 
Thus, if you can't define yourself as "the guy who really likes music theory and music cognition" in your new group, it's like that part of you goes away as well.
This is a pretty big deal, because for many aspiring academics, this is a huge part of your identity.

## Crescendo 

And the grim thing about this is realization is that post-PhD, it's only going to increase.
In a few weeks I am sure my ```dbake29@lsu.edu``` email address will be disconnected. 
I'll move further away in many respects because I'm not taking that next logical career step of doing a post-doc, a VAP, or getting the fetishzed "job"^[The job refers to a tenure track job in North America at a decent school near a city that you could imagine asking your partner to uproot their entire life so you can be a professor].
In taking other work, I will drift further away from the calendar rhythm of the academic year. 
And in many ways, I have already started to experience this.

In the past few Theory conferences I went to, things always got a bit awkward (for other people haha) when I told them that I didn't have a "job" for next year.
Many times I felt like I had to add a caveat to my response saying that I was planning on applying for more jobs next year, but next time with greater effort!
Though what made it the most weird, is that many people seemed almost not interested in what I was planning on doing this next year or, even worse, actually told me that if I did not take other work that was close to being a Theory professor I was just shooting myself in the foot for the rest of my academic career.
Someone even told me that I had to show that I could "put in my time" without any regard to any aspects of my personhood that were not the theorist in me.
This was off putting to say the least, but talking about this sad state of affairs is not a digression worth going on. 

Though this whole situation brings up quite the conundrum.
As people move through the PhD system, not everyone who gets a PhD in [Insert your subject here] is going to move on right away to a "job".
If they don't, the way things are currently set up they will start to spin a bit more out of the central orbit of the field.
At some point they might swing back in, or drift off. 
But it brings up what I think is an important question?

What does the space look like for academics who want to be part of the conversation, but don't neatly fit into a comprehensible box of current infrastructure?

Thoughout my PhD, I never really had this discussed.
And saw it coming.
Yet here I am.
Or more appropriatly-- here we are.
This group of people is only an ever growing population.
And will continue to be since it's numerically impossible to place every person in a "job" each year.

## My Answer

Of course, this is a very large question and problem that exists far beyond that of Music Theory.
It might even be happening in Musicology as well.

But regardless, there is some sort of space for people who are card carrying academics without a clubhouse to return to.
And I guess what I want to do here is instead of thinking of this space as academic purgatory and try to get out.
I want to try to think about establishing myself and others in this space.
And not just talk about it so it's a bit more normal, but also write about what it might look like to enjoy being in that space.

I don't really know what that will look like right now.
But in addition to all those thoguhts and feelings that I want to talk about, I also have a lot of practical work I want to share.
And I think my twitter feed and website might be a good place to do that.

Drafting up what I want to talk about post-PhD (even if it's just for me to be theraputic thoughts) I want to blog about, career diversity, life as a graduate student, computational musicology, music science, how music theory relates to everything, and a whole host of other things.
I really think there is a lot to be explored in this space.
And feel very inspired looking at even right now what the music landscape looks like.
Feel very inspired by people like 12tone who shows there is demand for critical thinking and music theory, Steve Keller on music and branding and advertising, and also think there is a whole chasm yyet to be discussed about how people with music PhDs (especially computational) might be helpful to the arts admin world reading blogs about arts managment and data like AB and Podcast.

So who knows.
I wanted to blog throughout much of my PhD, but just did not have the time.
Now on other side, really want to explore lots of topics to engage and share in spirit of true public musicology.

So get ready for a lot of thoughts, feelings, and opinions.
