# Post PhD Posts

## Context

Now that I'm over the last major milestone in my PhD lots of the structure around me has collapsed.
There are no more exams, no more deadlines, no more giant documents to write.
And it's not so much as the external strucutre, as  much of it was imposed on myself (as many friends will attest).
But something is missing and now very clearly have closed a chapter.
And it feels like that one scence in movie where it all just goes quiet and is very disorienting.
At choice in moment of silence.
On one hand can go back to the insanity and try to keep up the work load.

But if it did at that rate, not good for me in the long term.
Can't sustain it into my 50s, 60s, and 70s.
Won't be able to have the personal life I want 

Other one is to come down to earth
Instead of trying to be productive and academic rat race
Use time and energy to reflect on the last four years (six if you count MSc and year working as RA)
Reflect here and see what problems are 
Hopefully iron out and see what went well and what didnt 
Want others to learn from my mistakes and able to have same oppertunities that I did 
Do it in open allows for others to see
Very much like robert frost 

Lots of topics I want to talk about
	Interdisciplinarity 
	Asking quesstions
	Hidden curricula and values
	resources avalible 
	health 

	- Note finally done
	- What I might write about
	- Way to self reflect in open for other PhD students
	- trying to shed ID, but also important to let it out slowly 
	- And also student Rep for SMPC, one thing I hated was how quickly people forget 
	- Need Direction 
	- Here are possible topics 


Feel like one of the reasons I am attracted to the PhD is the stimulation.



Always thought I was a music junkie 
Able to hide away in a room for hours on end and really loose myself in a small passage.
Compound that with the constant, slow, tractable progress that practice affords.
It creates a sense of meaning bc you have a real example of effort contributing to progress.
And the marks are very clear in school, esp an american PhD.
On one side you have all the coursework.
Unlike UK PhDs, you need a lot of classes.
Here is a list of the ones that I took in my first five months.

## Caveat 

Who am i to say this?
Questioning it is acknowleding one path
