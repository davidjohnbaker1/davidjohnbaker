# Post PhD Posts

## Context

Now that I'm over the last major milestone in my PhD lots of the structure around me has collapsed.
There are no more exams, no more deadlines, no more giant documents to write.
And it's not so much as the external strucutre, as  much of it was imposed on myself (as many friends will attest).
But something is missing and now very clearly have closed a chapter.
And it feels like that one scence in movie where it all just goes quiet and is very disorienting.
At choice in moment of silence.
On one hand can go back to the insanity and try to keep up the work load.

But if it did at that rate, not good for me in the long term.
Can't sustain it into my 50s, 60s, and 70s.
Won't be able to have the personal life I want 

Other one is to come down to earth
Instead of trying to be productive and academic rat race
Use time and energy to reflect on the last four years (six if you count MSc and year working as RA)
Reflect here and see what problems are 
Hopefully iron out and see what went well and what didnt 
Want others to learn from my mistakes and able to have same oppertunities that I did 
Do it in open allows for others to see
Very much like robert frost (grass) 

Have the itch to blog a lot in the future and have a lot of ideas.
Especially after this past month.
Got to do a lot of cool stuff post PhD.

Since last post (back late april)
Presented at the Again and Again conference with some stuff from my dissertation. 
Went to BR with Evelyn.
Defended Dissertation.
Presented other part of research from thesis at Music Theory Midwest.
(thoughts on things to say at conference)
Then got to hang out in Columbus a few days with Dan.

Conferencing continued in California.
Got to share dissertation stuff with new group of people.
Think it was recieved well, but a bit technical for the other parts of the conference.
Seems like presenting idea that I did, would have been better served w examples
But really wanted to get the meachanism across and start  to be bridge between.
time to now take it all and move from tome to readable articles.

Then got to spend a bit of time in LA.
Took the train from Santa Barbara to south of LA.
Finally got some good mexican food.
Stayed with friend that I met via Goldsmtihs.
Also good timing that other friends were in LA or near.

Got to see Tanush.
Then hung out a day with 12tone and talked about weird music stuff.
Then spent day with Rachel being basic AF and walking up the Griffith.

Important lesson from a lot of this is that one of perks if you like it of academia is travel
And way to make the travel a lot better is to catch up with friends.
Provides a way to see much of the country with only really having to pay not tons.
Would pay for food anyway.
And always worht keeping in touch with friends and seeing waht they are up to.
Also talking with professional public theorist, political scientist, and psychologist.
Know that everyone is very much feeling similar thoughts abouts work and employment.

Back in London now.
Last week of Toynbee and data.
Going to hopefully blog about that next and how I see it linking up with world of research (PhD).
Then have a huge list of things I want to now talk about.
Thinking about... as long topics.

And then also have some other ones that I have like 80 percent ready to go on other thigns.
Going to use my blog and website as way of staying active in conversation.

Also since no longer a grad student and not on the TT right now.
Of course going to publish.
But also see it as important to keep social media presence.
Talk about what it means to have a PhD and still value work without doing the cookie cutter ideal.

Still very firm beliver that there are many ways to continue to get value from PhD after doing it.
Really want to be a living embodiement of that.
And important because after talking to a lot of people about what you as ECR need to know there are many ways.
And also want to rub in face of people who think there are other ways.
Good way to normalize this.
And write about it as I go right now because other people will want to know what's possible.
And still have lots of thoughts on grad school and research. 
Don't think should be excluded from the conversation because don't have a .edu email address now.

Thing on mind is lack of structure.
But it's not daily structure.
Pretty good at that, what I am wondering is where validation comes from.
And wonder how much of what we think we want about academia comes from everything laid out.
Also bc you really are only who you are in relation to other people.
Knew who I was among my grad cohort.
And between my music cog friends in London.
But if I am now working for other people they don't know that part of me.
So until get to be around that type of group on a normal occasion.
Going to think about my blog as a touch point of identity that I want to construct.
And identity that I hope to eventually have more established.
Might never have it totally if I don't get kind of job I want.
But six years is a long time to not have that.


Lots of topics I want to talk about
	Interdisciplinarity 
	Asking quesstions
	Hidden curricula and values
	resources avalible 
	health 

	- Note finally done
	- What I might write about
	- Way to self reflect in open for other PhD students
	- trying to shed ID, but also important to let it out slowly 
	- And also student Rep for SMPC, one thing I hated was how quickly people forget 
	- Need Direction 
	- Here are possible topics 


Feel like one of the reasons I am attracted to the PhD is the stimulation.



Always thought I was a music junkie 
Able to hide away in a room for hours on end and really loose myself in a small passage.
Compound that with the constant, slow, tractable progress that practice affords.
It creates a sense of meaning bc you have a real example of effort contributing to progress.
And the marks are very clear in school, esp an american PhD.
On one side you have all the coursework.
Unlike UK PhDs, you need a lot of classes.
Here is a list of the ones that I took in my first five months.

## Caveat 

Who am i to say this?
Questioning it is acknowleding one path


## Proof of Not going anywhere

* And have already started to experience this 
	- Felt like already starting to be perherperial orbit to conversations at both confs 
	- Insane to think at my career age how much everything is about 'the job' 
	- but what if don't want 'the job' right now?
	- First not lots of conversational oppertunities 
	- Second, was directly told by some people that my choice not to just take what was given to me basically automatically excludes me, shows that not willing to put time in
	- Very off putting for a number of reasons, wont go into here 
* Just makes point that, yes moving away from centricity 
* Want to go back to that space and centrality 
* But what do we do with people like me in the mean time (and I know there are many of us) 
* And importantly know this group of people will only grow
* Bc numerically it's impossible to place everyone in these positions.

How to include people who are also interested in theory, but not the career or job or politics 

* Not sure exactly at this point for me
* But one thing how I hope to do this with myself is stay active on social media with blog
* Could be threading away here or there, but not a fan of that (no archiving and makes you have to keep on Twitter at all times to stay up to date) 
* Instead hope to just write about things that people might care about 
	- career diversity
	- graduate student life 
	- general ideas on music, theory, and science 

Future posts might include...
And would love to write about anything that people would want to read about (especially with growing interest in computational musicology, music education and transfer, and what this space looks like for people who card carrying music theorists but don't have a clubhouse to return to).

Really have no idea where I am going with this and could crash and burn.
But want to give a voice and examples of template that I don't think really exists.
That is someone who has a PhD, self funded, looking to be academic at some point (seriously, like waht does it mean to keep active but not sell your soul), and all the thoughts that come long with that. 

Regardless, know that I find writing about my feelings and airing them out to dry on my blog is very personally helpful.
Anyone that knows me, knows I have a lot of opinions, and love me some good discussion, so hopefully going to be helpful overall.

## Answer 

- Blog about things
- Ways that people can stay active without having clubhouse to return to
- And give examples to people who have music background, want to apply it
- and someone who relly wants to be embodiement of carrer diversity and putting money where mouth is
- Really do think there is a lot to be said of getting PhD for many reasons that are not just training to be professor
- and just want to talk about that
- Very inspired by people like 12tone, steve keller, aubrey baumgarder
- Hopefully find space for myself in world like this. 

Though everything feels a bit disorienting at this point, I feel like now is a very good time to try to reflect on the past six years, which is something I want to do via this blog. 

And big part of that comes from not having very clear goals in the future bc outside the system. 

Until I get back in some sort of academic job, I will now be sliding outside the rhythm of the academic calendar.

So what you do with all these feeligns?
Back to point above of just wriing about them.

Big believer in the buddhist ideas of suffering and sharing it.

------------------------------------------------

And looking forward these feelings are probably only going to increase.
Lots of people cling on to them and live the dream in ways that are determintal to their own well-being.
Which is wild because these are very smart people.
If need any MORE proof that homo economicus doesn't exist, just look at what people do after finishing.
Makes no sense from a value point of view, but does have a lot to do with values (thanks david graeber).


------------------

* Stucture is missing 
	- I mean this at the background, not middle ground
	- Actually very much like the idea of things being very different every day and having a lot
	- With the sort of temporary swing out of the orbit, it seems like it's more the value and validation structure that rug under feet that is gone
	- Next logical step for me would have been post doc or VAP or TT (if i were serious about my academia career, keyword lol) 
	- Very quickly realizing that worth of a lot of people and self comes from this structure
	- And think it makes sense for who choose to do a PhD 
	- Lots of people who maxed out their ability to be a good boy
	- Probably high grades, high GRE, ability to internalize and embody elaborate value strutures 
	- Which is funny bc to really be sucessful in PhD, need to abandon that structure and learn for self
	- And if you don't you just get the thing where people are doing the type of research "the field wants you to do" (phrase someone used at a bar on trip that I love) 
	- Which at end of day is just way of elborate secreat handshake that we agree on what are values of hidden curricula of field
	- But not being 'a part of it' yet wanting to be a part of it, puts self in weird place.
