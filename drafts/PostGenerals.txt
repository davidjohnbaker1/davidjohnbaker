# Post Generals

Having finished generals have a lot more time to think than normal.
Doing a US PhD in Music Theory very different than experiences of my UK friends (a whole different post). 

Lots of time now to think about
	-Why music theory?
	-What is the point of a PhD?
	-Did I just waste a lot of time ? (No)
	-Why do a PhD? 
	-Why not psychology or neuro (luck out at LSU get to do both) 
	-What have I learned during coursework
	-What am I looking forward to about dissertation
	-What you 'have' to do and what you actually do
	
Big point is that it is an investment in yourself and subsequently the quality of life of those around you.

Lots of talk about the job market, yes, going to be rough.
Also huge amount of articles saying that PhD skills are transferrable (whatever that means)
If they are that tranferable, then getting a job should be easy.
I wonder if the stress just comes from wanting to get a VERY specific job.
When I think about it, my "dream job" is having someone (probably the US taxpayers or huge endowment) pay me to both teach people the value of music /studying and then also allow me to do research on musical questions.

Note that BOTH points are worht mentioning
	- Why study music? <-- related to question of PhD and investment in self 
	- Why do research in music?

Point of this blog post is to both reflect what good and bad has happened during coursework.

Want to put thoughts out there (as i think musicscience is only going to be more popular) on experience thus far.

Another blog post could serve to talk about why music theory as a way to study music science is an option-- who does it work for? 

# Coursework

* THIS IS JUST MY OPINION

There is a lot of it.
Make that very clear, especially coming from a background where I did not have an MA is Music Theory (essentially just a very expensive ticket to play the PhD game, ideally should be funded, thanks Kent Cleland)
During my time at LSU completed all the requirments of the Masters which included XYZ, continuation at the PhD level, as well as minor area.
Not only that, German translation, Piano prof, computer prof, plus research.

And in middle of that got funding (NSF, Goldsmiths) 

? Asked my MSc advisor about it, suggested if I REALLY think of it as research think of coursework as the job. 
? Importance of having both the time and respect from a faculty who really care about you.
? First year I spent way too much time with DS, learned a ton from the apprectince/master model
Also, unlike other programs I was considering, possiblity to work OUTSIDE of the music department.
I lucked out big time here as well. 
And really it was only because of connections I made at music science event.
Amy introduced me to Matt, who introduced me to Emily, currently workign on a paper.
Also helped to know R, ended up moving departments from teaching Aural Skills and Remedial to being the Stats TA.

In some ways, putting all eggs in one basket here but not if you consider that the R1 Tenure Track job as pure luck.
Need to be realistic about immediate future (post docs, jobs outside of academia, general quality of my life) so was good idea.

This is all done secondary to work in music theory.
I sometimes got my priorities out of order and had to bite the bullet.

OK with chalking it up to the fact that there is always going to be a lot on your plate and you are going to make mistakes.

What I liked about coursework
	-At end of day,my _background_ is in music so to dive that deeply in topics has been great
	-Experience teaching has really opened up some new ideas, lead me to dissertation idea
	-Def taught me to communicate to lots of people with different a priori assumptions about goals and methods 
	-Even grew to like Schenker as method for thinking about reductive techniques
	-Transformational class with Dr. Peck was also fascinating
	-TLDR is that each class was proof of music's infinite complexity and questions to puruse
	-Have a whole laundry list of empirical quesitons I want to follow up on
	-See it as a crockpot analogy, if you are REALLY investing in yourself on personal and career level, want to have a lot in there for a while

# Moving foward

Need to think about what is next for prospectus.
Getting half baked projects done.
Willingly only took three year offer, need to find both funding for summer (job?) and then funding for next year.
Luckily networking and having diverse skillset seems to be panning out, could do experimental statistics or other TAships, dissertaiton award?

Thing is I don't know and not at a school with buco bucks.
Actually coming up on LSU's annual game of financial chicken with LA Governement.
But important to remind people that MOST PEOPLE GO TO STATE SCHOOLS (538 article) and not everyone can be on 5 year fellowships.
Some sort of buddhist thing And that's OK. 

Doing the best that I can, very OK with that.
