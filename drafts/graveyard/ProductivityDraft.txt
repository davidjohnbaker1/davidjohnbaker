# Productivity Draft

Main Points: 
	1. To-Do Lists 
	2. Boundary Setting
		Local -- Pomodoro
		Global -- End day at 6, no emails on phone
	3. Your first 2 years you get swamped and also have to put in a weird amount of time on learning curves, sharpening ax idea

As I write this sentence I know exactly how much time until my next break (45 minutes and 39 seconds if you're interested).
When my Activity Timer dings I'll stop what I am doing, even if I am mid-thought and do something else.
Maybe I'll make a cup of tea, or maybe attend to that unread Facebook message, but most likely get on Twitter. 
I really have no idea what I will do, but I do know that as soon as my clock is not counting down I am technically 'off the clock'.

This might seem absolutly insane and 'Type A' (which if you know me personally, is not what I am like at all), but when it comes to productivity and being a graduate student, if you don't find something that works for you, you'll find yourself drowning an unending pile of work.
I'm weirdly proud of my 'productivity system' and after a brief exchange with @thomas_mock on Twitter yesterday I kind of wanted to put it to the test and see if I could whip out a blog post with it.
By documenting exacty how I do what I do, it'd remind me to practice what I preach as I enter the last four weeks of the semester.

Most of what I do falls into two categories: todo lists and boundary setting at the local and global level.
I'll explain each in turn.

## To Do Lists

Some of the best advice on to-do lists I got was from @richard_lewis when I was an RA at Goldsmiths where he showed me his to-do list which was a simple, flat text file (come to think of it, I think it was emacs org-mode) and gave me the sage advice of

only write down something on a to do list that you can do.

As dumb as it sounds, think of all the times you have written down something like 'Write Final Paper for American Music Class'.
You can't actually DO that in one sitting (and if you DO do things like that, you probably have a perfectionism/procrastination problem and HIGHLY reccomend this book to read), but you can DO all the component parts to that project.
So in order to write down all those 'things', what I do is structure my to-do list hierarchically into all of the projects or classes that I am currently working on.
My todo list is a flat-text file that I edit with VIM that takes advantage of the vimoutliner package found [here](https://github.com/vimoutliner/vimoutliner).
I access it by opening up my terminal (I also like to work as much as I can in Terminal on Mac because I am easily distracted and want to feel like I am hacking in the matrix) via an alias command.
I just type 'workflow' into my command line and it opens up the todo list.
To learn how to set this up, check out this link here.

The file then is organized hierarchically and ```vimoutliner``` color codes the indents.
At the top of the file I have major deadlines that I shouldn't forget about then as you look down are high level things like lsu, industry, and personal.
Under each larger level umbrella is the actual project which has its own folder/directory (often linked to a github repo, I love those green commit squares).
Then under the project are the actual to-dos.
Each line starts with an action verb in all caps followed by something I could do in one sitting.
Important to-dos get a ; which my text editor colors as red, which I associate with as important.

Here is what my current one looks like:

So when I am ready to work, all I do is type 'workflow' into Terminal, then have a whole list of things I can do and pick based on priority and what I have the mental energy for.
By having a few things to choose and having everything written down I don't carry around the constant I-have-so-much-to-do baggage.
I often tell people that if I don't write it down, I won't do it.
It's a double edged sword because on the positive side, you don't feel the mental heat I was tweeting about yesterday as things pile up.
They are just all on your to do list and you'll get to them when you sit down to work.
The negative side is that if you use this system and forget to write it down immediatly, you will forget to do it.

So with all this stuff to do, how do I actually then do it?

## Boundary Setting

The best and worst thing about graduate school is lack of structure.
It's fantastic in that I can work when I want, where I want, and as long as I meet my deadlines, my advisors won't crucify me.
It's terrible in that with no set boundaries, it creates this constant 'I should be working right now' culture (a world I am very familar with coming from an undergraduate degree in music where you just replace 'working' with 'practicing').
I have found that the best way to work around this is to set very firm boundaries both at a local and global level.

### Local Boundaries

One of the hardest things to do with work is to just start.
Often I don't start to work because I feel like the problems that I have to tackle are just too big, so why bother.
Add in a bit of self-doubt, fear of your work not being good enough, and looming thoughts of a terrible academic job market that your peers constantly remind you of and it's almost like why even bother?
The best way I get around that is to just start working by picking a certain amount of time you think you can commit your full attention to something.
It might be five minutes, ten minutes, the holy 20 minute pomodoro, or you might have the juice to sit down for 50 minutes (this session).
With that in mind, or knowing what I kind of feel like doing (writing, coding, emails) I press 'start' on my timer, open up my ```workflow``` and pick one of the thigns I already wrote down to do that could be done in one sitting.
While the clock is ticking down you have to JUST work on that.
No Facebook, no phone, no Twitter.
Don't even start a conversation with your labmate that walks in.
If they start talking to you, practice saying 'No' to them and tell them you are doing a pomodoro session and will be done in 9 minutes and 19 seconds (current clock).
When the timer goes off, stop.
Even if you are almost done! 
The reason for this is that so you can get a quick breather, think long term, then when you press 'Start' the next time, you will be barreling into your work!

I find that doing this just a few times will get me in a much healthier place in terms of work life boundaries. 
And the best thing about it is as soon as the clock stops, you're done and can make a cup of tea or coffee.

### Global Boundaries

The other important catch to this system is the need to set global boundaries.
What I mean by this is that you need to start working at about the same time every day and end at a reasonable time. 
I try to get into the office everyday at about 9AM and leave at about 6PM.
It's a long-ish work day (I take an hour lunch), but the best part is that having this regularity makes me happy.
It might seem like I am just doing a 9-5 thing, but since I'm a grad student (and ABD right now) I can just stop whenver I want!
I also sometimes work late because I weirdly really like what I do.

In addition to keeping semi-regular work hours I also do not have email or slack on my phone.
My first Music Theory teacher on syllabus day told the class 'there is no such thing as a music theory emergecy'.
He is correct.
If you are staying on top of your work and working healthily to a goal, this system is supposed to prevent you from running into a place where you are submitting something at the last possible second.

If after reading that you think "Dave, sounds like you just have a cushy grad position, probably don't work that hard, I work 60-70 hours a week as a grad student" I would have two things to say to you.
The first is that I don't believe you are as productive as you could be.
I will personally pay for the Go-Pro for you to wear all week and would be interested to know much time people accidently waste each day looking at social media.
The other is that you should take a solid look at your ability to say 'No' to people and consider the quality of life that you're living.

While there is something to be said about just falling into the depth of it all, especially at the start of grad school, I always try to do a bit of meta-thinking and ask myself if what I am doing is sustainable.
The first two years of my PhD were not and it lead to me being very depressed and irritable at times and I really credit this system with moving away from a lot of those very toxic mindsets that permeate many academic's social media feeds.
I'd really like to have my cake and eat it too with a healthy work and life balance and this is just one facet of my attempt to move closer to that goal.
