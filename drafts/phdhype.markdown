# PhD Hype

This past week was very special to me, I finally walked and got my PhD! 
Finally finishing it was a loooong time coming.
I've technically been in Grad School the past six years.
This is a one year MSc, a year working as an RA (ish) on the TM project, then four years of LSU.
Did a whole ton of work in this time.
If you will excuse the humble/brag, pre TT job search bragging... this includes 
This includes six courses in the MMB course, taking XXX at LSU, and also teaching X courses as IoR and TA'ing on a grad stats course.
And does not include having last year funded by campus wide dissertation award, a year volunteering at a charity, and a few industry projects.
Writing it out makes me realize why I am still tired months down the road.
I seriously need a long break. 
But intstead am having to work.
Should have instead went to portugal and sat on my gold mine there.

Now doing FDA, veritonic, Cuttime

But want to talk about my PhD thesis?

## Modeling Melodic Dictation

One thing that has been conspiciously missing from my blogging is writing about the dissertation I wrote last year.
I thought I was going to be able to blog about it while writing.
Turned out to not be the case-- mostly bc travel, crash, voulenteering-- and writing it.
But now that I have tons of time, can start writing about it and why people might be interested.

So even though I rep the #musicscience thing hard, I'm a card carrying music theorist.
Don't yell at me, but I kind of see the divides between humanities and sciences as arbitrary.
And see science as just a special case of the humanities if we are talking big, big picture.
Though becuase things in music cognition and music theory don't always seem to fit together (despite a giant ass history)
Felt very important that I got the correct dissertation question to spend a lot of time on it.
This is all post-hoc, but I feel like I can corrobrate a lot of this.

First off I wanted to pick something that I wouldn't laugh off.
Always thought it was weird when people say things like 'yeah what i do just doesn't matter'
and like laugh about it... like why spend time on something that doesn't matter or no one cares about?
Even if its just you... 
So first off had list of things I didn't want to write about.
Avoid classic thing in theory of B list composer with A list analysis or A list composer with B list analysis.
Love reading analysis but anyone that knows me knows I am bonkers about music and cognition.
Wanted something that dealt heavily with Ian Cross' cognitist
Or if you want this in more humanities terms, Babbit's other thing.

Second, really wanted the dissertation as a means to learn how to do new things.
And really wanted to define self and not be CC of any of my colleagues
On side note, think that the orgthogonality of reserach interestes really made for great dynamic in our cohort. 
For many traditional humanists like Sasha, means speaking a second langauge
Was not about to dive into the archives and seriously find lost John Adams pieces like Michael.
And did not have repitoire I knew inside and out like Jacob and got hints i shouldnt do schenker from professors.

In choosing a topic, did not just settle on my first one.
Streghts at time in this context were jazz and the computational stuff.
Have always been a jazz fan, play trumpet, and think the music is very valuable.
Had this crazy idea about creating a corpus of bad solos that got better like a longitidual design.
Then doing some ML to try to predict features that predicted expert ratings.
Still want to do this project if anyone wants to do something like this eventually.

Throughout time I was also working with EE in her working memory lab.
Was partiuclarly intersted in WM because it's what were tacitily dealing with a lot in teaching, esp aural skills.
Lots of people have pointed this out from LVH, TC, and Karpinski.
Most notably Berz.
And really liked that it linked up well with memory which is what I did in MSc.

It was actually after weeks of teaching aural skills that I realized this is where I felt like there was much to be done.
In teaching class noticed how much good material there was that combined theory and cognition.
The content is completly theory.
You are just talking about notes and abstract relationships and global key structures.
The how is all memory psychology.
We're telling people to focus, chunk, then coordinate many cognitive processes.
And at the bottom of the whole thing are assumptions of near transfer (getting better will make you better at other thigns)
And best of all, it's littered with folk psychology.
Just think of all the irritation discussions about fixed and moveable do.
Conversations are really about fundamental processes and representations of the perception of music! 
Exactly what I was intersted in.

Knowing I was hovering in on this topic, the next question was how to ask what questions.
MD is a mouthful as soon as you start to think about it, but luckily humanities backgrounds prepare you for any size quetions.
Jsut gotta start whittling it away so you can fit it into your page count.
But then what I need to do is find ways to answer this question, but maybe find excuses to pick up and refine power tools I was intersted in.
By this I mean all the computational and statistcal methods that one would need to do this.
Now not just interested in learning this stuf (was) because of connections with science
Many of my humanities friends are like wtf why
And one side of it is that the world is complicated and simple tools just won't cut it.
Not about to t-test the shit out of the world.
The other side is that all this computational stuff overlaps nicely with budding world of data science.
Part of that appeals to my nerd other part to the dread of not getting a TT job.
Spoiler alert: didn't get a TT offer and not even close, but landed safely in world of work.

So all these things kind of coalesed into some pintrest worthy shit.
Igakori
First is what I was good at -- love music and cognition and memory, have computer and psych training with music 
Second is what world needs- 100% lack of research in aural skills AND a very practical pedagogical application
Third is what I love -- no problems there 
Fourth is can be paid for it -- nice auxilary add on near the end.

And with the fourth one, as mentioned before in blog posts there is no false dichotomy between good questiosn and skills.
Def nice to be able to do whatever you want, but kind of figured had rest of life to do that.
And more imporantly I wanted to hedge my bets early and not depend on the crumbling pyramid scheme to ask the questions I wanted.
Wanted to walk out of PhD with as many of the skills as I could bc know I'd not be getting that kind of enviroment anytime soon.

So ended up writing a dissertation on melodic dictation.
Future posts will look at the highlights of each of the chapters for people taht don't want to read it.
But that's how I ended up picking the topic I did.
Really hope that following advice of McCandles and picking advice is way to go.
Just know its a very unconventional topic.

More posts coming, but here's a link to the abstract.
And if you want to read it you can get the PDF from LSU here OR if you want you can check out the online (unofficial!) version where it's hosted as a website for easy navigation.
You'll also notice I have the whole thing as a freely availble github repo if anyone wants anything from it.
Will talk more about that later, but think that's enough for now. 




In picking a question, really wanted to do something that I loved.
