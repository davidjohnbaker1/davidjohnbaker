	- Get outside your discipline, fast , for me psych, there is more money there, more friends, sanity check 
	- Try to publish sooner rather than later
	- Use twitter like right now, front page of academia, very humanizing
	- Use your gym, productivity creep 
	- Do not go on trips without taking personal time 
	- You have to cash in on the perks, you're an idiot if you don't try to make that happen 
	- Learn to meet people at conference
	- Find what the industry connection to your field is, they have the data
	- Abe Lincoln, tree axe sharpen, things like R will be frustrating, don't learn them alone
