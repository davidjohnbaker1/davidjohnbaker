Hidden Curricula 
Structure

Now that I'm over the last major milestone in my PhD lots of the structure around me has collapsed.
There are no more exams, no more deadlines, no more giant documents to write.
And it's not so much as the external strucutre, as  much of it was imposed on myself (as many friends will attest).
But something is missing.
And it feels like that one scence in movie where it all just goes quiet and is very disorienting.
Part of me really craves that structure to continue.
But if it did at that rate, not good for me in the long term.
Can't sustain it into my 50s, 60s, and 70s.
Won't be able to have the personal life I want 
So part of me wants to keep going down that path
But better choice is to take all this bagage and then reflect on it with 

Feel like one of the reasons I am attracted to the PhD is the stimulation.



Always thought I was a music junkie 
Able to hide away in a room for hours on end and really loose myself in a small passage.
Compound that with the constant, slow, tractable progress that practice affords.
It creates a sense of meaning bc you have a real example of effort contributing to progress.
And the marks are very clear in school, esp an american PhD.
On one side you have all the coursework.
Unlike UK PhDs, you need a lot of classes.
Here is a list of the ones that I took in my first five months.

Not only that, had to pay your way to teach for a lof of PhD people.

Double edged sword
