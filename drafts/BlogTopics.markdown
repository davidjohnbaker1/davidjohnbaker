### Suggestions for PhD (Fresh)

* Post on What I think (fresh out of the gate) was good and bad
* And want to come back to this and reflect on what I said in five and ten years
* But if wait to long, will not capture some of the freshness and anxiety of it
* Good choices
	- Investing in self 
	- Trying to make lots of friends and connections (conferences) 
	- Avoiding fad research (if someone made career w it in MT, probably too old now) 
	- Which is concerning
	- Informal learning 
		- Jeff Perry
		- Jacob Gran 
		- Conversations with peers 
	- Think about career diversity immediatly (easy to do with science_
		- Numerically impossible
		- Financially stupid not to
		- Need to put money where mouth is 
		- Value this via idea of internships
		- remember from prior post, need to know if you're actually a flow junkie
