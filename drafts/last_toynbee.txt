Last Day at Toynbee

After year, time is now up with time as residential volunteer worker at Toynbee Hall.
Haven't been blogging about it much, but this is something that I've invested a lot of time in this year.

Want to talk about two things.

1. What was I even doing?
2. What new ideas do I have that I want to share? 

What I did while I was there.
	- Taken on as Research and Evaluation residential voluenteer worker
		- said one thing on the description 
		- structure got shuffled around while I was there and broke off to just resarch
		- basically, just like academia, roving position where played to strenths
		- for me that included doing data, writing, organizing events, and some field research, training
		- Notice here that job was very much like what academics are asked to be able to do 
		- There were larger projects in need of addressing that needed to be reported on
		- but not everythign is about the manuscript at the end , varying level projects
		- seems obvious to people outside academic structure, but assume right now that is the readership 
		- so might have big year long report, might instead have small local grant to write about 
	- Job crafting for DS
		- Lucky that I wasn't a full employee, so could do a bit of job crafting
		- Tried to push towards all things data sciecne right away to see where theory met practice
		- so as a result spent a lot of time, and i mean a lot of time, cleaning data
		- taking it from pre-formatted excel sheets to make it tidy
			- had survey data from money, relating it to income
			- only by breaking it down to tidy can realize much of data people decided not to report (not mcar) 
		- Then realy getting to know the data via visualsation and had Tukey/peng lightbulb moments
		- Feel right into the datasciecne noob trap, wanted to do fancy algorithms I read about
		- But time is much, much better served with simple visualizations of survey data
		- Quickly realized that job is researcher, not data shaman
		- So best thing to then do is to try to pass on ideas in training about best quant data practice
			- collecting variables at lowest level 
			- encourating free text responses 
			- rephrasing questions for maximum granularity (income brackets vs income) 
		- So TLDR had nice crash course in what you read in the blogs vs what you need by Friday
	- Other "researcher"-y things
		- Lots of writing, helped out on a lot of reports
		- Ability to create a narrative is super important 
		- thinking about the audience and what they know and point of getting information across
		- Helping out on small things here or there (went out to do interviews for project, chance to run training)
		- Also got to run the datathon which I've blogged about before.
		- Most important to realize that skills doing research are applicabile
		- Wanted to say same form with different content, but really same form with total differnt langauge and value structure (and diffrent content)
		- Which leads to next point about what is new  
And new thoughts I have
	- If you want to help people, just go to a charity 
		- lot of people struggle with what they do in the context of the world right now
		- there is a whole divison of work out there trying to change that
		- Instead of doubling down on focusing on papers where only you benefit practically
		- instead say no to bubble over demands of academia so you have free time to also help 
		- really thought a lot about this last point because some of the research that they do at Toynbee Hall
	- When you do research, think about who benefits from it
		- Bit of background it's a charity with very old roots
		- idea was settlelemnt then go on to do other things
		- A lot of people in area, especially older people go there for support 
		- Which brings up interesting question, what does it mean to do research there?
		- Academic--> long, cleansed route where stay objective and look to literature for answers, get published, turned to policy bc its real
		- not only option
		- Can instead just ask people what are their problems, bring them along in the process
		- approach called PAR
		- Idea is to have community be co-researchers in project, let them develop questions, and help throughout
		- give example, easier to see how it changes from what is done in the tower
		- imagine have project on needs of older people in local community
		- could read up on it, make lit review, develop yet another survey, yada
		- or could use connections in community to just ask older people
		- they did this last year, got together team of co-researchers
		- trained them, developed questions together, then used network of 20 older people to reach 400 in community
		- not only gets representitive sample beyond slapping a turk up 
		- but know in the process something like their access to information and isolation is a factor
		- so in interviewing them and putting this in dialouge, able to give them information as to where to get support and friends
		- even before months of rounds of submissions, able to have impact on the community
		- and unlike tower model, when something gets published, can you really stare in the eyes of those who are oppresed and tell them they benefited?
		- really calls into question beneficiaries of the time and effort that is put in to work. 
		- Been a topic on my mind a lot now for many things I do: who benefits from this choice? 
	- I think humanities PhDs should have similar placements
		- y
		- gets you out of the tower for a bit
		- can actually apply the skills people tell you that you have rather than think you have
		- langauge is totally different in how you present yourself and values of culture
		- find out that you hate open office designs
		- also chance to live a lifestyle outside of the tower grind
		- might find out that you think it's music (or psych or whatever) that you love
		- but really its research and helping people and being part of community with shared values
