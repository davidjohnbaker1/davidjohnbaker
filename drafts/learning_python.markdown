# Learning Python

https://brohrer.github.io/numpy_resources.html

As R person, had to learn python.
Did the thing at first where scrambled because had interview where they did mostly Python.
Luckily stats and ML knowledge got me thru.
But not in a place where I need to learn Python (for data analysis, tho personally now can do R, more intersted long term other stuff too bc can't help myself)
So what is the way to do it?

Part of larger series on dataproofing your PhD??

Step one, play off your strong suit.
Learning R, needed to probaly learned programming and stats at same time.
And because of this, had nice interaction effect (maybe) where at least feelings are bundled into something bigger than themselves.
Can now go back and just do the programming part.

Basically I was like X is to Y as Z is to Q.
Of course I know that there are not just one X or Y with R and this will not be case with Python.
Sure there are tons of libraries.

So I just started as if I were teaching a class on Python, tho have done no python.

## Getting Python

* What is the CRAN of Python?

* What is the RStudio of Python?

* WTF is a Juypiter notebook? 

## Massive Book for PhD Students 

* Rationale: If you're doing PhD clearly smart and probably very good at figuring out how to tick boxes.
* Though you get into research and rules of game have changed
* You're doing stuff on the edge of knowledge, so there is no guide 
* Hitchhikers
* And to make matters worse, the people who have the jobs you want mostly don't have the skills you need
* This is not a knock to them, the same was probably true for them
* And if read History of Science, know that will not be true for you.

* So given it seems like a total free-for-all, what's a girl to do?
* What I wanted to do was pool all the resources that I used to patchwork together my education
* Not nessecarily a list of tutorials you sit and click thru
* This is a serious list of readings and books that if you read and talk about with your peers will help you 
* in the world of things becoming more techincial.

* Will help your research and have it so it leans hard into data science
* Why? Because the job market for academics sucks
* And I wanted to flex my resources in the time I had to this area
* Most importantly though, will make you useful as a researcher.
